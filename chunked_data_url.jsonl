The right team is an essential part of growing a small business, which means how you hire and fire employees can be key to your success. But for empathetic leaders, including those who focus on potential and view their business as an extended family, this process can be especially challenging. Consider these 10 tips (six for hiring and four for firing) as you build your team. Tips for hiring There\u2019s a lot that goes into the decision to hire \u2014 including money. The average cost per hire is more than $4,000, per the Society for Human Resource Managers. To make that investment successful, it\u2019s important to consider the who, when, and how \u2014 as well as the role itself. 1. Determine the workload. Write down a list of tasks that aren\u2019t getting done that you expect a new hire to do. Examine if it\u2019s a cohesive role. 2. Set your budget. Think about what salary you can afford and then be sure to price in onboarding or training, employment insurance, and taxes like Social Security and Medicare. 3. Assess your options. Depending on the workload and your budget, explore the pros and cons of the different types of employees\u2014salaried, hourly, temporary, intern, or contracted. Start to think about the type of person that would be a good fit for the role. 4. Cast a wide net. Start with a compelling job description and post to job sites, message boards, and even social media. This can help you find candidates outside your immediate network, which is a good way to boost diversity and gain exposure to new people and ideas that can help your business.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/10-ideas-for-small-business-staffing/"}
{"id": "77701ace068f-2", "text": "Ask for and follow through on any references they offer. It can be easy to skip these steps as a small business owner, but due diligence at this stage can pay off down the road. 5. Provide measurable objectives. This helps you match candidate skills to the position. Plus, you establish clear expectations that can help you define success later on. 6. Test the waters. If you\u2019re not sure about the role you\u2019re looking to fill or the skill sets you need, start with a consultant or freelancer. Either hire the person on a per-project basis or invite a candidate to work with you for a day (paid, of course) to see whether they\u2019re a good fit.\n\nWebsites that pair companies and jobs with freelancers \u2014 such as Guru or Upwork \u2014 can help you find someone with the right experience levels and within your budget. 7. Weigh your opportunity costs. When you continue to invest in the wrong employee, you\u2019re missing out on a chance to hire the right employee who could help advance your business. 8. Analyze the fit. If an employee is a bad fit for a role, letting them go may mean they find a new job better suited to their skills. 9. Stick to facts. One benefit of clearly defining the jobs you hire for (tip five), is that it makes it easier to explain underperformance if it happens. If you\u2019ve discussed the issues and haven\u2019t seen improvement, it may be appropriate to part ways. 10. Ask for help. It can be challenging to handle tough decisions on your own. If you need insight or advice, consult with a mentor, fellow business owner, or confidant. Just be sure to protect any personal details.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/10-ideas-for-small-business-staffing/"}

If you\u2019re just starting a business or if you\u2019re a sole proprietor, figuring out how to separate the expenses tied to your business from your personal finances can take some getting used to. It can also take time to open business accounts and get the systems in place to properly track your business financials. But that separation is important \u2014 it can help you determine how healthy your business is, and it makes life much easier around tax time. Follow three steps to help you create healthy boundaries between your accounts that may pay off in the long run. 1. Track expenses To create a successful business, it\u2019s critical to understand your costs. But for business owners who are just starting out, it\u2019s common to use things you have on hand or to pay for supplies with your personal accounts. This makes it harder to estimate the true cost of producing your goods or services, as well as your real operating costs. Start tracking your expenses by keeping receipts for anything business-related.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/3-steps-to-separating-business-and-personal-finances/"}
{"id": "b73807d44afc-1", "text": "Create a habit by putting receipts in one place. If you have a mix of paper and digital, consider taking photos of your paper receipts or printing your digital receipts so you can keep everything in one central location.

Additionally, you\u2019ll start to get a more accurate read on what it costs to run your business, which can help you price your products and services fairly. Underestimating your costs can lead you to price your products or services too low. Overestimating expenses, on the other hand, might make your business seem less profitable than it is, which could be an issue if you ever decide to seek financing.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/3-steps-to-separating-business-and-personal-finances/"}

You can start by earmarking a personal account for this, but as your business grows, consider upgrading to accounts designed to serve small businesses. 2. Track income It can be tempting to add income generated from a new business to any other income you might be making, especially if you\u2019re paid in cash or working as a sole proprietor. However, keeping this income separate is important for both tax purposes and your ability to build and grow your business. Keep a log of every sale you make and how you\u2019re paid. These logs can be as simple as a notebook or a spreadsheet. This can help you see how much revenue you\u2019re generating from your business, and it can help you identify patterns. Do you make more money on weekends or when the weather is bad? They\u2019ll also help you at tax time. Generally, business owners must file quarterly tax estimates.\u00a0You can base these payments on your previous year\u2019s earnings, but it can improve your cash flow to use real records of your income and expenses for the quarter. 3. Look for opportunities Keeping good, separate records can help you establish a baseline for what \u201cnormal\u201d is, so you can start to think about what growth looks like. Consider these questions as a starting point:\n\nAre these sales sustainable? Analyze whether you can keep sales consistent each month. Are you making a profit? Subtract your expenses from your income. If you\u2019re making more than you\u2019re spending, you might take the profits as personal income or reinvest the money back into your business. What does growth look like? Think about the best way to grow: scaling how much business you do, lowering costs, or something else entirely.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/3-steps-to-separating-business-and-personal-finances/"}

Remember, one of the main reasons to keep separate, detailed records is to be strategic about growth.\n\nIf you\u2019re running your business in addition to another job, detailed records can help you figure out if and when to take the plunge and work on your business full-time. For this decision, take a close look at your personal expenses as well to see if cutting back might mean you\u2019re able to make the shift sooner.

Use these tips to get clearer on your goals. When we say, \u201cDon\u2019t shortchange yourself,\u201d we mean it. Businesses need capital to grow, yet just 25% of women entrepreneurs seek funding, compared to 34% of men. When they do ask for funding, women ask for $35,000 less than men do, on average. Not only can that limit your growth in the immediate future, but it can affect you in the long term, too. Business growth improves business value, and that can set you up to receive more funding down the road. If you\u2019re ready to get growing, you can use these questions and insights to help you determine just how much money you\u2019d like to ask for. Keep in mind that there\u2019s no magic number or equation. But there are considerations around what you want to spend on, how much that may cost, when you want to get started, and whether you\u2019re in a position to ask for it right now. Also use the worksheet How much money should you ask for? (PDF) to capture the details and do the math so you can make a well-informed choice. What do I need the money for? Homing in on why you want the money will help you figure out the amount you need and what type of loan to seek. The first step? Make a wish list of improvements, whether it\u2019s purchasing new equipment, hiring additional staff to meet increasing demand or open an additional location, or stocking extra inventory to hedge against supply chain problems. This may sound basic but clarifying the purpose for the money will help you figure out not just the amount, but also how to present your goals to a would-be lender, banker, or investor.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/4-questions-to-ask-yourself-before-asking-for-money/"}

It may seem fun to get the latest tech gadget, for instance, but if it won\u2019t save or make you more money than it costs, you may want to go for something more practical. When do I want to get started? Now think about the timing for each desired project or purchase: Is this something you want or need to do ASAP \u2014 or can it wait a bit? The timing can also affect the type of funding you seek. For instance, funding new equipment or renting a new location is a large capital commitment that might be suited to a long-term business loan with repayment terms of 3 to 10 years. On the other hand, if you need to stock up on inventory quickly to prepare for a big order, a short-term business loan with repayment terms of 1 year or less might be more suitable.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/4-questions-to-ask-yourself-before-asking-for-money/"}

How much will it cost me? Once you\u2019ve clarified what you need the money for and when, you\u2019re ready to move to the next step: naming your desired amount. There\u2019s no one right answer for this, as the right amount to ask for depends on your business needs, credit history, and risk tolerance. To make an educated ask, first do some research to get an estimate of how much your goals or improvements will cost you \u2014 at the time you plan to buy or make them. For example, if you want to buy a building but you aren\u2019t ready to do so until next year, consider that the market could go up or down. (It\u2019s good practice to build in some wiggle room; that way if prices go up drastically, you\u2019re still on track.) How much debt can I afford to take on?

Your business credit rating affects the amount you can borrow and the interest rate, but so does your personal credit score, since you\u2019re an entrepreneur. Your long-term business plan. If you haven\u2019t fleshed out or re-calculated these goals recently, it\u2019s a good idea to do so now. Create milestones with cash flow projections over the next three years, and think about future cash flow patterns, too. Some businesses take out as much as possible \u2014 only to find that it still isn\u2019t enough to do what they\u2019d planned because of a lag in deposits or market ups and downs. The cost and terms of borrowing. Take into account how long you need the money for and/or how quickly you can pay it back. A higher interest rate may be tolerable if you won\u2019t be repaying it for long. This will also affect the total cost of the loan. Look at the interest rates of various loans and the total you will be paying back over time.\n\nThe benefits of seeking funding from an investor If you choose the right investor, you may gain access to their network and expertise, which can help you in many ways now and in the future.

Starting and running a small business is a massive commitment of both money and time. Many people underestimate the time investment that it takes in the first few years of a business to get it off the ground, fully operational, and on track to success. In fact, time management tends to be one of the biggest issues for small-business owners. These tips can help you better manage your time and may even help you find the elusive work-life balance that drives many entrepreneurs to start businesses in the first place. 1. Use tech to work smarter and faster Many business owners love technology, and for a good reason \u2014 it can make your life easier. There are a limitless number of tech tools that can help you schedule business activities and automate processes. For instance, there\u2019s software that can help you track your hours so you can see how you\u2019re spending your time. (Slack, Asana, and Trello are some of the more popular choices.) If payroll takes you hours, you could consider looking at software that automates payroll (QuickBooks, Peachtree, Paychex, or similar). By getting \u201csmart\u201d about how you run your business, you can save enormous amounts of time and focus your energy on other duties or areas of your life. It can also help you find opportunities to delegate.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/4-skills-you-need-for-better-work-life-balance/"}

Be sure you know all the capabilities available with your current plans \u2014 and what else you could add. 2. Learn how to let go and delegate Delegating can be tough for business owners. Between money being too tight to justify a new hire, to fear of \u201closing control\u201d of certain processes, many small-business owners fall into the trap of doing everything themselves. Start by documenting your process for the things you do each day (the technology you set up in step one may be able to help with this). Once you have these processes in place, think about which tasks you procrastinate about, which are time-consuming or which don\u2019t require decision making. When you\u2019ve decided what to delegate, choose someone with the skill set and personality to suit those tasks. That may be someone on your team or a new hire. Taking the time to find a good match can make delegation (and training) much easier, and you will quickly see a return on your investment in the person you hire.\n\nTechnology can help you outsource unpleasant or time-consuming tasks. Check out talent marketplace websites like UpWork or Fiverr and start posting opportunities there. 3. Put personal time on your calendar Setting aside uninterrupted time for your family and personal interests is crucial to striking a work-life balance and can make you more present when you do show up for work. For instance, you could make it a point to have nights with your partner or spend quality time with your kids, if you have them. Also, if volunteer work is important to you, make sure you set aside time for those non-business, community activities. Making time away from work can keep you fresh, too: Spend time on hobbies separate from your business, like gaming, home renovation, gardening, or whatever else you like. Time away from work can have the added benefit of helping with new ideas and creating a fresh perspective.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/4-skills-you-need-for-better-work-life-balance/"}

Talking candidly about your business can help you realize which parts you enjoy and which you don\u2019t, which can help you delegate better. Spending all your energy on your business, 24/7/365, without recognizing the need for balance can easily lead to burnout in both your business and personal life.

Here\u2019s what owners should know (and do) about it. A steady stream of cash is key to a successful business, but that\u2019s just one part of the entire financial picture. It\u2019s also important to maintain a strong liquidity ratio, which indicates the business is able to pay off its existing debts with its existing assets. The easier an asset is to access quickly, the more liquid it is. Cash is generally the most liquid asset because it\u2019s available at the touch of a few buttons on an ATM pad or a digital app \u2014 or sometimes in your wallet. The better a business\u2019s liquidity ratio, the more attractive it will be to lenders and investors, both of which can be extremely important for growth. While this may sound fairly simple, there are several ways to calculate a business\u2019s liquidity ratios. Understanding liquidity ratios One of the most common types of liquidity ratios used to determine a company\u2019s financial health is the current ratio. This compares all of the business\u2019s current assets to all of its current obligations. Sometimes, lenders and investors will also look at your quick ratio or your cash ratio. The former factors in only the business assets that can be accessed relatively quickly, and the latter focuses even more narrowly, comparing obligations to only cash and cash equivalents. To calculate your business\u2019s liquidity ratio, you\u2019ll be dividing the assets (current, quick, or cash) by business liabilities (debts/obligations). What the numbers mean Lenders and investors may use liquidity ratio calculations to determine how healthy your business is. They generally want to know that you have cash flow under control, you spend responsibly, and you pay off your debts. Here\u2019s what counts as healthy, high, or low.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/5-ways-to-improve-your-liquidity-ratio/"}
{"id": "4e3cab31a170-2", "text": "Healthy current ratio: A business with a healthy current ratio can typically meet its short-term demands and still have enough cash to invest or expand. Generally, a current ratio of 1.0 means that a company\u2019s liabilities do not exceed its liquid assets, though this can vary by industry. Numbers below 1.0 may be acceptable in industries where there\u2019s a quicker turnover in product and/or payment cycles are shorter. In this case, lenders may compare the business\u2019s liquidity score to the industry average to determine its status. High current ratio: This refers to a ratio higher than 1.0, and it occurs when a business holds on to too much cash that could be used or invested in other ways. Low current ratio: A ratio lower than 1.0 can result in a business having trouble paying short-term obligations. As such, it may make the business look like a bigger risk for lenders and investors.\n\nWhat business owners can do Here are five ways to improve your liquidity ratio if it\u2019s on the low side:", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/5-ways-to-improve-your-liquidity-ratio/"}

There are many types of overhead that you may be able to reduce \u2014 such as rent, utilities, and insurance \u2014 by negotiating or shopping around. You can also look at where you expend time and energy. One example: If your company has a paper trail, going digital can save you time and money that\u2019s now spent submitting and accepting paper checks. Sell unnecessary assets. Eliminating items such as surplus business equipment can provide a small sum of capital and reduce the average cost of equipment maintenance. Change your payment cycle. Talk to your vendors about opportunities for discounts if you pay early, which can save you hundreds to thousands of dollars. On the flip side, you can consider offering your customers discounts for submitting payments ahead of schedule. Look into a line of credit. A line of credit could help you cover gaps in cash flow due to payment schedules. Some business lines of credit offer access to up to $100,000 per year, with no annual fee for the first year. If you\u2019re considering this, compare terms before choosing a lender to work with. Revisit your debt obligations. If you have short-term debt, switching to long-term debt can require smaller monthly payments and give you more time to pay off the sum. On the flip side, switching long-term debt to short-term debt may mean higher monthly payments, but it can also mean that your debt will be paid off more quickly. Also consider options like debt consolidation and loan refinancing, which may help lower monthly payments now, while also saving you money in the long-term.\n\nArticle\n\nYou might also like\n\nUsing credit to stabilize your cash flow\n\nHere's how the right credit products can help level things out.\n\nCreating a cash flow projection\n\nIdentify potential cash shortfalls \u2014 and surpluses \u2014 in your business's future.\n\nWe\u2019re here to help\n\nProducts & services tailored to your business needs Get started\n\nTalk with a banker\n\nMake an appointment\n\nAdditional resources", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/5-ways-to-improve-your-liquidity-ratio/"}

The best way for investors to know how you\u2019re going to treat their money is to look at how you treat your money. It\u2019s similar to the way a traditional mortgage lender looks at a credit report, an investor looks at a business\u2019s financial statements, including your balance sheet, which represents your assets, liabilities, and net worth in an easy-to-digest format. The structure of a balance sheet is built around a basic financial accounting equation: assets \u2013 liabilities = owner\u2019s equity Here\u2019s a breakdown of those terms as well as valuable tips, resources, and examples to help you create a snapshot of your business financials.\n\nAssets Assets include the value of everything owned by and owed to the business. On a balance sheet, assets are usually split into current and non-current assets. Current assets are cash and those items that are likely to become cash in one year or less, such as inventory, accounts receivable (amounts due in the short term), and notes receivable (amounts due within 12 months). Fixed assets, such as real estate and equipment, are categorized as non-current because they are less likely to sell in a year or less. For purposes of the balance sheet, assets will equal the sum of your current and non-current assets \u2014 less the depreciation (or decrease in value over time) of those assets.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/a-business-owners-guide-to-balance-sheets/"}
{"id": "0bc462363d30-1", "text": "Liabilities On the other side of the equation are your liabilities, both short- and long-term, which are the monetary obligations you owe to banks, creditors, and vendors. Short-term liabilities include accounts payable, such as monthly invoices owed to vendors and creditors, and notes payable owed to others within the next 12 months. Long-term liabilities, or those due more than a year away, include a mortgage balance payable beyond the current year.\n\nOwner\u2019s equity The last component of the balance sheet is owner\u2019s equity, sometimes referred to as net worth. This is your net investment in the company. It\u2019s equal to total assets minus total liabilities. The financial statement should balance, showing assets equaling liabilities plus owner\u2019s equity.\n\nMaking balance sheets work for you While all balance sheets follow the same equation, the types of accounts listed will vary based on the type of business. Product-based companies, such as retailers, sell goods to consumers and have overhead expenses like inventory and real estate. Service-based companies, like dry cleaners or law firms, sell services instead of goods, so they do not typically have inventory or raw products on the balance sheet. The method and time period in which payment is accepted may also change what\u2019s listed in the balance sheet. Balance sheets are usually drafted at the end of accounting periods: monthly, quarterly, or yearly. It\u2019s a good idea to look at these documents alongside others such as income statements (which show long-term profits minus losses) and cash-flow statements (which show how quickly revenue is collected). A financial advisor can help you create and analyze these financial statements for a clear picture of your cash flow.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/a-business-owners-guide-to-balance-sheets/"}
{"id": "0bc462363d30-2", "text": "Helpful resources Balance sheets can be created with ease, even if you\u2019re not an accounting professional. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers free online learning courses on running a successful business as well as live webinars, which may include courses on accounting.

There are a number of financing options developed specifically for small businesses. But traditional loans, lines of credit, and credit cards may not always be the best options. Plus, newer businesses may not qualify, since you generally need to be in business for a set period of time in order to do so. The good news is, there are various financing options available to new and existing businesses. Here are five. 1. Seller financing If you\u2019re buying a big-ticket item for your business, the seller may offer financing. This is most common with vehicles, real estate, and large equipment. You may be able to take advantage of sales incentives, such as 0% interest for a specified period or lower sticker prices. 2.

This type of loan is intended to help with cash flow, since you aren\u2019t really borrowing money so much as receiving an advance on the money you\u2019re owed. 3. Crowdfunding (or peer lending) There are a few forums that connect businesses with potential investors. Generally, you post what you need help funding \u2014 whether it\u2019s a specific project or your business overall \u2014 and lenders can decide if they want to support you. Depending on the platform you use, this money may be offered as a grant, a loan, or somewhere in between (e.g., you may need to send investors a free product sample but not repay the funds). It\u2019s interesting to note that while women are much less likely to receive venture funds from investors, they\u2019re more successful when it comes to crowdfunding (a 70 percent success rate compared to men\u2019s 61 percent). 4.

Make sure you understand the terms \u2014 whether it\u2019s credit card interest rates or the parameters on a home equity line of credit \u2014 since your personal financial health is on the line. 5. Grants and microloans Consider applying for grants intended to help women business owners, or businesses in your industry or location.

A business credit application goes through various steps to evaluate and ensure a fair and thorough review. A single application can be seen by lenders, underwriters, and analysts \u2014 or it can go through a quick automated process, depending on the size and type of credit requested. In all cases, it is vital to provide accurate and up-to-date information on the application. This will help it move through the process as quickly as possible. As you await a reply, you may be interested to know what\u2019s happening behind the scenes. These are some of the stages that your application may go through before you hear back from the lender. 1. Initial verification The first group to handle the loan application will check the facts. This group will ensure that the information on the application is accurate and that the lender has all the necessary data to make a decision. Some of the things they will verify are:\n\nIncome and expenses Time in business and/or age of business (if purchased form a previous owner) Personal and business credit reports Ownership records", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/applying-for-business-credit-what-happens-after-i-apply/"}
{"id": "c1ddc1412ca0-1", "text": "If the business has accounts with the lender, that information will be analyzed as well. For example, lenders may review such things as checking and savings accounts, the date those accounts were opened, and the 12-month average balances, as well as credit card account balances and payments. 2. Scoring Once all the data from the application is verified, the lender will give the business a score to determine its creditworthiness. Some factors that come into play include cash flow, expenses, debt, the age of the business, and what collateral is available. It\u2019s important to keep in mind the numbers often vary from lender to lender. Some lenders use the FICO\u00ae Score model (for real estate loans, for example), while others use the FICO\u00ae Auto Score (for vehicle loans) or the FICO\u00ae Bankcard Score (for credit cards). They will also look at personal and business scores. And some lenders may use scoring models other than FICO\u00ae.1 Many lenders will use industry-specific scoring, too, because different types of businesses have different levels of", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/applying-for-business-credit-what-happens-after-i-apply/"}

For example, healthcare practices generally have a steadier year-round cash flow than food service and seasonal businesses.

However, the pandemic has impacted many businesses in different ways \u2014 including some healthcare practices, which saw drops in patient visits \u2014 so that may impact scores, too. Learn more at Understanding Credit Scores. 3. Underwriting Scoring is more or less automatic \u2014 and may result in an automatic approval \u2014 but in some cases, the decision to approve a loan may shift to the underwriter. It is the underwriter\u2019s job to take a much more detailed and nuanced view of the numbers and make the ultimate decision whether the level of risk to the lender is acceptable. The underwriter can decide whether a factor indicating higher risk (such as few years in business) is offset by other strengths (such as experience launching previous businesses", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/applying-for-business-credit-what-happens-after-i-apply/"}

Yet, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that many minority-owned businesses, especially those owned by solopreneurs, have little time to devote to these efforts. There\u2019s no rule that you have to make major updates and upgrades all at once, and there are more resources available than you might think. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s worth making online upgrades part of your business plan this year \u2014 and how to find help easing into it.\n\nGet excited If you\u2019ve made it this far, you may be wondering why you should bother building an online presence. It\u2019s simple: Customers and prospects today are increasingly searching for businesses online. More than half of consumers today (64%) have been using a mix of online and in-person shopping for the past 6 months, per the Bazaarvoice 2022 Shopper Experience Index. And that trend is likely to continue. PwC predicts that e-commerce is expected to make up 95% of sales by 2040. Also consider this: In recent years, nearly one-third of global consumers have begun prioritizing purchases from minority-owned businesses \u2014 especially younger generations that are also known for being digital-savvy.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/boost-your-online-presence/"}
{"id": "a5e307b71b8f-1", "text": "Get verified You can start to build an online presence without investing time and money into building a website (though you may want to do that later). Many people use crowd-sourced reviews on various websites to find information about businesses, so these third-party platforms are a great way to start building a digital footprint for your company. You can register your business with review sites like Yelp and search engines like Google. (Creating a Google Business profile only takes a few minutes, though you\u2019ll be asked to verify by mail that you\u2019re the business owner. This helps protect your business but can take a few weeks.) These and other online shopping and review sites are also giving businesses a way to identify as minority-owned. For example, Google Merchant Center provides an option to identify your business as Black-owned, Latino-owned, veteran-owned, or women-owned. Google Digital Coaches also provide free training and coaching to help Black and Latinx small businesses create a thriving online presence. It may be worth your while to research what your favorite shopping sites are offering to help minority-owned businesses. Not only do consumers use these sites to discover companies, the sites themselves often provide metrics about how many people searched for your business and what percentage engaged to find out more.\n\nAction tip: Boost your relevance once you\u2019ve registered your business or created a profile by asking customers to post reviews. Monitor these comments since they can help you better understand your customers, and good feedback can convince prospects to pick you.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/boost-your-online-presence/"}

This is just one type of small business that shoppers are seeking on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Pinterest. Creating social media pages lets you share information without creating a full-fledged website. You can instantly communicate a product launch, for example. It also makes it easier to have two-way conversations with customers, which can be helpful if you\u2019re not sure what products or services to keep or phase out. A number of social media sites also have e-commerce options, so customers can make purchases from your business via the social platform.\n\nGet a website If you\u2019re seeing a lot of traction on social media, consider creating your own website.

Small businesses have several financing choices in addition to traditional bank financing that may help maintain a steady, positive cash flow. Here are a few options that you might want to consider. Seller financing: Sellers of big-ticket items like real estate, large equipment, or vehicles might offer financing directly to the buyer. These sellers sometimes offer sales incentives as part of their financing deals, such as 0% interest for a specified period of time or lower sticker prices. Factoring (accounts receivable financing): This is a way to get the money from your business\u2019s accounts receivable earlier by selling the invoice to a bank or a finance company in exchange for a percentage of the invoice amount (the factor will generally take a percentage or fee, resulting in your business receiving an amount lower than the face value of the invoices). This can be an option if your business is in need of immediate cash flow. Online only lenders: You can get just about anything online, including loans. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is an example in which online \u201cplatforms\u201d connect businesses with investors willing to buy or invest in the loan. Bank Loans: The most common form used for financing. There are various kinds of loans which can be short or long-term depending on the purpose. Personal financing: It can be difficult for a new small business to obtain financing when first starting out, so many small business owners use personal funds, personal credit cards, home equity, or personal lines of credit in order to get established. Community development grants or loans: Nonprofits dedicated to helping small businesses provide small loans and grants, usually backed by donations or government funds.\n\nArticle\n\nYou might also like", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/borrowing-options/"}

While it\u2019s often discussed in the context of Fortune 500 companies, small businesses can reap the many benefits as well. When you build relationships \u2014 internally, as well as with partners and vendors \u2014 that reflect a variety of backgrounds and perspectives, it can lead to innovation and growth, as well as a deeper connection with your customers. What is diversity?\n\nWe traditionally think of diversity as a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds, including different genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, and more.\n\nIn business, diversity can also refer to diversity of thought or experience, like living abroad or having worked in a different field.\n\nWhat are the benefits?\n\nWorking with a diverse group of people, from your suppliers to your staff, can provide inspiration. When you bring together unique and different perspectives, the conversations and ideas tend to be more nuanced, richer, and more representative. This may ultimately lead to a better business, from operations and products to the customers you attract.\n\nAt larger corporations, diversity is often linked directly to innovation and revenue driven by innovation. You can apply this same thinking to your business.\n\nIn fact, a diverse staff may be able to better connect with your current customers or help you win new customers. If someone on your team shares an ethnicity with a potential client, they\u2019re more likely to understand that client and help you win that business.\n\nHow can I build a more diverse team?", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/building-diversity-into-your-small-business/"}
{"id": "dad1a2d60b5b-1", "text": "How can I build a more diverse team?\n\nIf you have few (or no) employees, you can still reap the benefits of a diverse network. Apply the same thinking to your suppliers, partners, contractors, and so on.\n\nTo build a diverse team, first evaluate what voices and perspectives may be missing. For instance, if you notice a large number of your clients are Latinx, and you don\u2019t have any Latinx employees or consultants, you could be missing an opportunity.\n\nNext, reach outside your network when hiring or sourcing. We often hire from within our immediate circle or based on referrals from our close contacts, and this can narrow our reach. Instead, post jobs on message boards and websites aimed at broadening your pool. As businesses across industries struggle with historic levels of staff shortages, searching in new places for candidates can be another way to attract the talent you need.\n\nAction tip: Try to incorporate diversity beyond your immediate team; actively seek out diverse suppliers and vendors.\n\nIn addition to diversity on your team (and with your partners), think about how you attract diverse customers. Do your marketing materials show people of all races and genders? Do you make sure all of your customers are treated respectfully, regardless of background, income level, or age?\n\nThese may seem like small or obvious steps, but they add up and make a big difference to how your company is perceived.\n\nHow can I foster innovation?\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to hire people with diverse perspectives. In order to build a diverse workplace \u2014 and harness the innovation that it can create \u2014 you need to make sure your team and network feel supported.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/building-diversity-into-your-small-business/"}
{"id": "dad1a2d60b5b-2", "text": "To build a culture that fosters collaboration and creativity, consider who you consult on important decisions and how you react to ideas from team members. For instance, it\u2019s normal to value the opinions of trusted advisors more highly. But what might this preference look like to another, newer team member? Might it appear that you\u2019re discounting the opinions of others?\n\nAction tip: Seek out ideas that might challenge your point of view as the business owner. It may mean asking suppliers, advisors, and even customers for feedback. Even if you don\u2019t change your mind, your original idea may become stronger in the process.\n\nDevelop a system that allows people (employees, consultants, partners, or anyone else you work with) to share open and honest feedback. A more formal process can make it easier for team members to share concerns or suggestions than a face-to-face conversation. Making it a system means fostering diverse opinions that will become part of your workplace culture as you grow your business.\n\nWhile prioritizing diversity, it\u2019s also important to ensure that your workplace environment \u2014 physically and culturally \u2014 is welcoming to all. For example, if you are bringing on a new hire who uses a wheelchair, make sure the office is set up so that person has the same access as all other staff.\n\nAction tip: Avoid putting people on the spot about their unique experience. Focus on making people comfortable enough to share, versus requiring they do so.\n\nBuilding a diverse network and team can lead to direct business outcomes, but it\u2019s about more than business. Fostering diversity should be done thoughtfully. Focus on creating an inclusive business that represents a variety of individuals and ideas. Empathy and innovation could very well go hand in hand.\n\nSources: SCORE, Harvard Business Review, McKinsey & Company, The Creative Independent\n\nArticle\n\nYou might also like\n\nProtect your business from supply chain disruptions", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/building-diversity-into-your-small-business/"}

And while Black-, Asian-, and Hispanic-owned businesses were as likely as white-owned businesses to apply for credit in 2020, they were much less likely to receive the funding they sought: 58% of white-owned businesses said they received all of the credit they requested, compared to just 36% of Black-owned businesses and 35% of Asian-owned businesses.1\n\nSmall business owners\n\nThis inequity means that if you\u2019re a minority business owner, you\u2019re more likely to turn to higher-risk options to meet your funding needs. Higher-risk options tend to cost more, come with a shorter repayment term, and increase a borrower\u2019s risk of late payments and default. Regardless of what type of financing you are able to obtain, it\u2019s important to understand the level of risk you are taking on. Consider the following financing options and their relative levels of risk.\n\nLower risk\n\nLower-risk financing options offer predictability and thorough underwriting processes to help ensure your business is in a good position to repay them.\n\nTraditional business loans Provided by banks and other financial institutions, traditional business loans typically have fixed interest rates, which means business owners can anticipate exactly how much they\u2019ll need to pay over the life of the loan. The terms on a business loan depend on your credit, business finances, time in business, type of business, and other factors.2", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/business-financing-options-for-small-business/"}
{"id": "1cd5f94e4202-1", "text": "Business lines of credit A business line of credit is similar to a traditional loan, except that it provides an ongoing and reusable option to access capital up to a certain cap. Lines of credit lower risk by allowing you to borrow only what you need at any given time, reducing the amount you have to pay back over time. However, be aware that lines of credit often have variable interest rates, which rise and fall along with prevailing rates. In a rising rate environment, your loan will grow more expensive over time.\n\nSBA Loans The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers a series of loan programs that are administered by partner lenders throughout the country, often targeting borrowers who are not well served by the traditional lending industry. SBA loans are among the lowest-risk borrowing options, as they come with low rates and may be accompanied by support, such as business advice or financial management help.\n\nModerate risk\n\nThese options come with higher interest rates or other features that make them somewhat more risky for borrowers.\n\nShort-term business loans These bank loans are structured as typical installment loans, but on a short timeframe \u2014 usually three to 10 years. Short-term business loans often have higher interest rates than longer-term loans, which can make them more difficult to repay successfully.\n\nInvoice factoring Like a merchant cash advance, invoice factoring allows a lender to use revenue you haven\u2019t yet collected as collateral for a loan. However, invoice factoring, which is most often available via alternative online lenders, is somewhat less risky than a merchant cash advance. That\u2019s because the invoices are specific expected payments that can be collected upon. Invoice factoring can be a reasonable option for businesses with certain cash flow needs, such as slow payment from certain customers or seasonal ups and downs.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/business-financing-options-for-small-business/"}
{"id": "1cd5f94e4202-2", "text": "Venture capital (VC) Venture capital investors generally do not require personal assets as collateral. Likewise, venture capitalists (VCs) typically don\u2019t expect business owners to pay back their investments on a particular time schedule. Instead, VCs seek equity in the company and also may assume a decision-making role \u2014 potentially taking more ownership and decision-making power than the founder is comfortable giving up.\n\nHigher risk\n\nThese options put your personal credit at risk, and some carry high interest rates.\n\nPersonal loans Using personal loans from a bank or credit union to fund a business is very risky: Inability to pay back a personal loan will damage your personal credit. If you must give a personal guarantee or put up collateral of a personal nature \u2014 for instance, you might take out a home equity loan or line of credit using your home as collateral \u2014 those assets can be foreclosed on if the business defaults.\n\nMerchant cash advances These loans, offered by alternative lenders that often operate online, treat your business\u2019s future revenues as an asset to lend against. Advances are high risk because you are borrowing against money you don\u2019t yet have; if you don\u2019t bring in the predicted amount of revenue, you will be at risk of defaulting on the loan. Since these loans are considered high risk, they often have high interest rates and rigid repayment terms.\n\nPersonal credit cards Credit cards often come with high interest rates, which can make repayment increasingly difficult over time. Using personal credit cards for business purposes \u2014 a common tactic for many small business owners, especially early in the life of the business \u2014 puts your personal credit at risk.\n\nBorrow confidently Like many small business owners, you may be reluctant to take on debt. But with a better understanding of your options and how each could help your business grow, you can feel more confident in assessing the capital you need to reach your goals.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/business-financing-options-for-small-business/"}

Lenders often evaluate loan applications based on hard numbers: your company\u2019s cash-flow statements and balance sheet, your personal income, debts, credit scores, and the like. But because of wealth disparities, some entrepreneurs start out with less liquid capital than others. Black and Hispanic households in the U.S. have, on average, about 15% to 20% as much net wealth as their white peers.1 But don\u2019t let how much money you have, or don\u2019t have, in your bank account keep you from applying. Lenders also consider other vital information, from your business plan and career background to compelling research on your customers. Here are four tips to help small business owners frame that information and provide additional details to strengthen a loan application. Our accompanying worksheet(link opens in a new tab) will help ensure you\u2019re well organized to help improve your chance of securing the cash your company needs.\n\nMaking your best impression\n\nFocus on these key areas to strengthen your application\n\nBusiness plan\n\nPayback plan\n\nYour team\n\nYour story\n\n1. Start with your business plan Lenders will look carefully at your business plan, along with your income and debt statements. It\u2019s one of the best ways to shine because there\u2019s so much you can put into it. (See our step-by-step guide to writing a business plan for more information.)", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/business-loan-application-best-practices/"}
{"id": "0d36f2259153-1", "text": "Use big-picture sections like the executive summary to sell your vision for your business. Tell the story of why you launched it and what market gaps or societal needs it answers, especially if you serve an underrepresented customer base. Back all of that up with industry research that demonstrates your business case, laying out the size of the target market, customer base, and growth potential.\n\nNext, dive into the financials. Lay out every detail you can in current income statements and balance sheets, as well as cash-flow and income projections. You\u2019ll build an impressive, realistic financial road map showing exactly where your company is now and where you intend to take it.\n\n2. Describe how you plan to use the loan \u2014 and pay it back Another great tactic is to put yourself in the lender\u2019s shoes. Prepare detailed answers for everything they might ask about how their financial assistance will help your business succeed. Provide details about how you plan to use the capital. You may be looking to buy new equipment, for example, or move your company to a more profitable location.2\n\nAlso be ready to describe how you plan to pay the money back. Depending on the length of your loan, prepare a yearly projection plan that lays out details on projected sales and a payment plan for each year. Provide a list of key customers, as well as customer demographics and any advantages you may have in catering to your customers. The more sharply you can bring your clients into focus, the more assurance the lender will have that you know your market and will use their money well.3\n\nConsider collateral, too. If you\u2019re applying for a loan that requires it, map out every asset you have to help secure the loan.2 If you don\u2019t have that kind of capital, there are other options. The Small Business Administration\u2019s SBA 7(a) loans don\u2019t require collateral for loans up to $25,000. Just be sure to do your research so you understand the full range of options and their conditions.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/business-loan-application-best-practices/"}
{"id": "0d36f2259153-2", "text": "3. Pitch yourself and your team Don\u2019t just introduce lenders to your business: Let them get to know you, too. Use a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to show, through concrete examples, that you have the experience to run a thriving business and manage the loan well. While these details may not directly affect a lender\u2019s decision on your loan, they can help you build relationships with your banker.\n\nIt can also help to include a personal background document that walks lenders through any other basics they might want to know: addresses where you\u2019ve lived, degrees and qualifications you\u2019ve earned, and name changes, for example.\n\nIf you have one, be equally thorough about your team. Highlight individual strengths and any special expertise that gives your business a competitive advantage. You\u2019re introducing the lender to more people they can trust.\n\n4. Telling your story builds trust and confidence The more supplemental details you provide to potential lenders, the better. In addition to showing that you\u2019re honest and thorough about your financial position, they also give you the chance to put those numbers in valuable context and start a dialogue with lenders about your company. Preparing that information will also hone your sense of what loan type and amount works best for you. Rejection is always possible, but it doesn\u2019t mean the end of the road. If a lender declines your application, ask if they\u2019ll share why or need additional information from you. You can also look for alternatives to traditional loans, such as crowdfunding and community-focused grants. For example, some businesses serving local communities are eligible for loans through a federal program called the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. Financial details will always be a primary factor in a loan application. But with careful preparation, you can bring lenders a compelling pitch that accurately represents the full scope of your business as it stands today \u2014 and where you plan to take it in the future.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/business-loan-application-best-practices/"}

When you work for yourself, you likely don\u2019t have managers or colleagues who can sing your praises or introduce you to a room of new people. That means networking is even more important to get you in front of potential partners, advisors, and connections. \u201cWe have realized because of the pandemic that we are so interconnected. To be successful entrepreneurs, we need one another more than we ever imagined before,\u201d says Ramiro Cavazos, president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve learned that our net worth as businesses and business owners is our network.\u201d\n\nFinding the right approach for your business \u2014 and yourself Many people may feel awkward about self-promotion. But networking can be especially challenging for diverse business owners, who may feel uncomfortable in certain spaces.\n\nHowever, you can overcome these challenges by redefining networking in ways that make sense for your business and your community. Here are four networking strategies beyond mix-and mingle events that can help expand your network in ways that feel more authentic.\n\n1. Participate in community service events\n\nBy volunteering with local organizations that you highly regard, you\u2019re likely to meet like-minded individuals who share your values and passions. For example, you could mentor youths from underserved areas, support church outreach events, or volunteer on the board of a nonprofit whose cause matters to you.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/company-networking-on-your-own-terms/"}
{"id": "509fb9fb02b9-1", "text": "The professionals you work with in these circumstances may be more likely to support your business because they know you are connected to a common purpose. There\u2019s also an added benefit on a personal level: You will interact with people in your backyard and potentially inspire community members to entrepreneurship.\n\n2. Rekindle professional relationships\n\nIt\u2019s easy to underestimate the connections we already have, but don\u2019t forget to tap into these relationships. You may have past mentors, clients, instructors, or other informal supporters who can help you take your business to the next level. Also consider connections you\u2019ve made at past networking events, but with whom you didn\u2019t get to follow up.\n\nTo reconnect, reach out via email, phone, or direct message through platforms such as LinkedIn. These supporters can lead you to new business opportunities, giving you valuable insights and simply providing listening ears when you need support. Get intentional about sustaining these relationships: Set calendar reminders to follow up every month or quarter.\n\n3. Lean into online communities\n\nThere are a multitude of interest- and industry-based social media groups where diverse small business owners share resources and advice on how to deal with challenges.\n\nSearch for relevant groups on Facebook and LinkedIn, as well as Reddit forums. For example, group discussions may include how owners in your industry are dealing with inflation when purchasing supplies or what they\u2019re doing to combat higher interest rates. These informal online interactions may feel less invasive than traditional in-person networking. Post and answer questions in these groups. If you see someone you want to connect with further, ask to send them a direct message or schedule a virtual lunch.\n\nUse your social media channels to engage with people and companies you admire or want to work with. Following someone on Instagram and engaging with their posts could spark a conversation, while interacting on LinkedIn could result in a one-on-one meeting or a broader discussion.\n\n4. Attend industry or community-specific conferences and events", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/company-networking-on-your-own-terms/"}
{"id": "509fb9fb02b9-2", "text": "4. Attend industry or community-specific conferences and events\n\nConsider attending professional conferences, which can foster relationships with industry peers. Building connections with people in your region allows you to connect about the local state of business. Reach out to the local Chamber of Commerce that aligns with you, such as those for the Black, Hispanic, Pan Asian or disabled communities. These groups typically host events and offer specialized opportunities to build relationships.\n\nYou might even sign up for online speed networking events where you are randomly matched with other participants. This format puts all participants on a level playing field, which can help reduce awkwardness. Also look for relevant workshops and discussion groups hosted by your alma mater or a nearby college.\n\nMany diverse small business owners have forged their own paths to success.

Even businesses with healthy growth and strong sales run the risk of owing more than they can pay in a given month. Fortunately, spending less than an hour each month on a cash flow projection can help you identify potential cash shortfalls in the months ahead. Before you create a cash flow projection for your business, it\u2019s important to identify your key assumptions about how cash flows in and out of your business each month. Identifying some key assumptions Key assumptions should relate to two primary areas:\n\nReceivables: These assumptions should outline how quickly you receive payment from your customers. For example, if most of your customers pay you within 30 days, a key assumption could be: 90% of sales will be collected the month after the sale. Payables: These assumptions should outline when your payments are due. For example, if your vendors require payment within 2 weeks of delivery, a key assumption could be: Payables are due within 14 days of purchase.\n\nDon\u2019t let optimism factor into your key assumptions. Only the most likely numbers should appear on your spreadsheet. Drafting your cash flow projection With these realistic assumptions in hand, you can begin drafting your cash flow projection. To get started, create 12 columns across the top of a spreadsheet, representing the next 12 months. Then, in another column on the left-hand side, list the following cash flow categories and enter the appropriate amount in each column for each month (see descriptions below):", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/creating-a-cash-flow-projection/"}

Uses of cash: List every likely expense your business may incur, such as payroll, accounts payable to vendors, rent and loan payments, etc. Total uses of cash: Tally all your expenses so you can see exactly what will be going out the door each month. Excess (deficit) of cash: This is the number that counts. If you see positive numbers across the board, congratulations! You may have some extra dollars to invest back into your business. If you see a negative number for one of the months, don\u2019t panic: You have time and options to prepare your business.\n\nSample cash flow projections Here is an example of a cash flow projection that has been abbreviated to 4 months for the sake of simplicity: XYZ Company, LLC Internal Cash Flow Projections August to November\n\nOperating cash, beginning\n\nAugust\n\nSeptember\n\nOctober\n\nNovember\n\nBeginning amount\n\n$3,000\n\n$1,000\n\n$800\n\n$800\n\nSources of cash\n\nAugust\n\nSeptember\n\nOctober\n\nNovember\n\nReceivable collections\n\n$65,000\n\n$60,000\n\n$70,000\n\n$65,000\n\nCustomer deposits\n\n$10,000\n\n$12,000\n\n$10,000\n\n$10,000\n\nLoans from the bank \u2013 Revolving line $18,000 $20,000 $15,000 $16,000\n\nOther\n\n$3,000\n\nN/A\n\n$5,000\n\nN/A\n\nTotal sources of cash, beginning $99,000 $93,000 $100,800 $91,800\n\nUses of cash\n\nAugust\n\nSeptember", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/creating-a-cash-flow-projection/"}

A 5% variance one way or the other can be okay, but if it starts being more than 5%, you should revisit your key assumptions to check for flaws in your logic. Even if your actual numbers come in higher than your projections, you should take a close look at your assumptions, because higher returns in the short term could lead to shortfalls later on. To make sure your projection stays accurate throughout the year, be sure to consider these variable expenses.\n\nMonths with three payrolls Months when insurance premiums are due Increased estimated taxes due to increased sales\n\nTo make sure you have some cushion when unforeseen costs arise, it\u2019s a good idea to designate an amount equal to 10% of revenues for \u201cother expenses\u201d under \u201cUses of cash.\u201d Continue to refine your projection To keep your projections on track, create a rolling 12-month plan that you update at the end of each month. If you add a new month to the end every time a month is completed, you\u2019ll always have a long-term grasp of your business\u2019s financial health. However, don\u2019t try to project more than 12 months into the future. If you look too far into the future: One, it may take a lot of your time. Two, many variables can change. Prime rates could go up, for example.\n\nIf possible, delegate projection updates to a bookkeeper or accountant. Beyond saving you time, this allows you to take a higher-level view of the projection and will help you identify errors more easily.

It helps you easily see whether you\u2019re becoming more profitable or losing funds. Here, we\u2019ll explore the key components of a P&L statement for small business and give you an example to reference as you create your own statement. What is a P&L statement? A P&L showcases a company\u2019s income and expenses over a certain time period. Typically, a business makes a P&L statement quarterly or annually \u2014 but they also can be done more frequently. Consider reviewing a few recent statements together to look for trends. This can be particularly helpful if you\u2019re weighing any big financial decisions.

But it\u2019s important to understand what goes into them as if you were running the numbers yourself. There are two main parts of a P&L report: income and expenses. However, the order in which things are calculated is designed to give you a better understanding of your business and operations. 1. Sales The first thing reported on a P&L statement is the business\u2019s revenue from sales. Other forms of income \u2014 such as investment income \u2014 are factored in later. 2. Cost of goods sold (COGS) Next, businesses that sell goods must figure the cost of the goods they\u2019ve sold.

Expenses Expenses are next. These are expenses tied to running your business, and not those tied to the creation of specific products (which were covered in COGS). This is where you\u2019ll see payroll, office supplies, payments to lawyers or accountants, interest paid on any loans, advertising costs, and more. One thing to keep in mind: If you are purchasing an asset (equipment, a computer, a car, etc.), it\u2019s considered a capital expenditure, and the accounting is different than more basic expenses. 6.

Even businesses that have high gross profits can post losses if their expenses get out of hand. And this is the type of thing you can look for when you reference your P&L on a regular basis. 7. P&L example Consider a small pizza restaurant with $100,000 in yearly sales. The restaurant\u2019s COGS includes ingredients and packaging and comes to $7,000. (Since the restaurant\u2019s staff is on payroll, they get paid regardless of the number of pizzas sold. That means labor wouldn\u2019t factor into COGS; it will be factored in later as a payroll expense.) The pizza shop owns their building and collects rent from a tenant, which supplies $5,000 in additional income. Sales ($100,000) minus COGS ($7,000) equals gross profit of $93,000.

Gross profit ($98,000) less total expenses ($73,000) equals a net profit of $25,000. This example is meant to be illustrative, and for a new business, a profit margin of 25% is considered high. (Turn this into a percent by dividing your net profit by your gross profit and multiplying by 100.) Plus, some industries have higher profit margins by nature. Look up what an average profit margin is for your industry and use the P&L reports you\u2019re running to understand how you stack up. If your profit margins are higher than your industry, see if you can maintain that margin as you grow.

A recent study conducted by the U.S. Small Business Administration found that the majority of small business owners feel their business may be vulnerable to a cyberattack. Yet many do not take action because they feel they don\u2019t have the time or financial resources to invest in cybersecurity \u2014 or they simply don\u2019t know where to begin. Here\u2019s the thing: You might not be able to afford the security infrastructure of a large corporation but there are basic security principles that any business can follow, no matter its size. The Federal Trade Commission offers tips and tools to help enhance your small business security. Keep in mind, Wells Fargo is watching out for you by consistently enhancing our security measures and identifying new and emerging threats to help keep your accounts and information secure. In addition, you can help yourself by taking steps to further enhance your security. Your first step: Developing a cybersecurity plan. Creating a thorough plan is worth the effort, as it will help prioritize your next steps and determine what your business really needs. Here\u2019s how to start: Identify your assets and potential threats\n\nCreate a document that lists all your physical technology assets, such as computers and servers, and catalog who has access to each. Create a separate list of digital assets, such as customer records and intellectual property, and note where that information is stored. Note any cloud-based systems you use \u2014 any software or data you access via the internet vs. a local computer drive. Once these documents are complete, use them to identify your most important assets and list potential threats to each. As you develop your cybersecurity plan, ensure that these threats are addressed.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/cybersecurity-planning-for-any-small-business/"}
{"id": "a907528c3588-1", "text": "Tip: Review your cybersecurity plan at least yearly to make sure it stays current and relevant to your business. Review your vendors\u2019 standards\n\nAll of your technology and Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors need to be compliant with regulatory requirements and other emerging standards, such as American National Standard Institute and National Institute of Standards and Technology, commonly cited as ANSI/NIST, SOC 2 Type II certification for data security, and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Review vendor practices at least annually to ensure continued compliance with industry standards. Make sure your service agreements with your technology vendors address any security concerns \u2014 cybersecurity needs to be built into any agreement. Check that your SaaS providers are protecting sensitive customer data such as credit card details or other personal information and are compliant with relevant data privacy laws such as GLBA, GDPR, and HIPPA.. Make sure your financial institution\u2019s approach to cybersecurity fits your own: look for multifactor authentication, strong encryption practices, and continuous monitoring of all account activity. Set minimum security requirements for your suppliers and develop defense with \u201cAssume Breach\u201d in mind. This means a business approaches its cybersecurity anticipating that there is already a compromise.\n\nTip: Avoid physical theft, too.

Passwords should be a minimum of 12 characters (the longer the better) and use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Use strong authentication measures. Explore the possibility of using two-factor authentication and single sign-on (which unifies login information with the various third-party software portals your company may use) to lessen the odds and impact of a compromised account. To investigate these options, you can download a free authentication generator or purchase a package from a trusted security provider. Devise a tiered system for assigning administrative rights to users, so that not all employees have access to all information. Also be sure to revoke access when an employee leaves the company or when a contractor\u2019s work is complete. Train employees and contractors to recognize and avoid security risks and report suspicious activity. For example, ransomware attacks often succeed when an employee opens a malicious file on a work device through a personal email account or USB device.

Explore whether your business may be able to protect and isolate sensitive data within your network using multilayered encryption. Approaches to encryption vary in complexity from business to business, so consider which elements make most sense for your business to encrypt. To help protect yourself, ensure all devices on your network are running the latest software. Enable automatic updates and patches to your software to help protect against viruses, malware, and threats. Frequently back up local data to the cloud and other local storage to preserve data in case of an attack. Consider a trial run of any new solutions so you can fully assess if a product will suit your needs. Use encryption on Wi-Fi routers and provide separate networks for guest access.\n\nTip: Change your router\u2019s admin password.

Try these 3 steps\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nLearn more about why your application may have been denied, and explore resources to get back on track. If your application for business credit was turned down, use it as an opportunity to understand why and learn how you may be able to improve your credit profile before you apply again. 1. Determine why the credit request was denied There are lots of reasons a lender might be unwilling to extend credit. They can include:\n\nInsufficient credit history No proven ability to pay off a loan Derogatory items on a credit report such as late charges, a lien or a bankruptcy Lack of collateral to secure a loan\n\nWhen a loan or other credit type is denied, you can ask the lender to share the reasons for denial in writing. Understanding why credit was denied can help you better use the various resources available to help. The National Foundation on Credit Counseling offers services specifically for small business owners. 2. Understand what lenders look for While a personal credit score might be a key factor, lenders also focus on other factors related to your business\u2019s financial performance. In other words: your business\u2019s track record matters. When reviewing an application, a lender will consider:\n\nIs the business viable in the short and long term? Are the owners making payments on time? Do they maintain a stable, positive cash flow and/or cash reserves that can support current and future payment obligations? Do they have an existing banking relationship?", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/denied-credit-for-your-small-business-try-these-3-steps/"}
{"id": "f7c49d17d420-1", "text": "You may be asked for a business plan, too. For some applications, like Small Business Administration (SBA) loans and lines of credit, this is required. In other cases, it\u2019s just a \u201cnice-to-have\u201d that helps lenders understand the type and amount of financing an applicant might request. Your personal credit history matters a great deal, too. Especially in a business\u2019s early days, lenders may rely more heavily on personal credit history when evaluating credit risk. Consider taking the time to improve or rebuild your credit score before reapplying. 3. Consider secured credit options When you\u2019re ready, make small forays into business financing using secured loan products. Secured credit may be an option for small businesses that might not qualify for unsecured credit and those seeking to establish or rebuild credit. For instance, you can spend some time building up your savings so that you can use it as collateral for a credit card or line of credit that is secured by the savings. Vehicles or equipment might also be used as collateral. Obtaining business financing without an established credit history can be difficult. The key is to work at building a positive credit profile with smaller loan products and demonstrating personal financial responsibility by consistently making all debt payments on time.\n\nArticle\n\nYou might also like\n\nThe benefits of women\n\n\n\nand minority\n\n\n\nowned certification\n\nGetting certified can help you discover opportunities and generate business.\n\nWe\u2019re here to help\n\nProducts & services tailored to your business needs Get started\n\nTalk with a banker\n\nMake an appointment\n\nAdditional resources\n\nMilestone Mapping Coaching Circles Get hands-on help setting and reaching business goals from a network of peer-mentors and industry experts.\n\nSmall Business Resources How to start, manage, and grow your business.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nMilestone Mapping Coaching Circles Get hands-on help setting and reaching business goals from a network of peer-mentors and industry experts.\n\nSmall Business Resources How to start, manage, and grow your business.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/denied-credit-for-your-small-business-try-these-3-steps/"}

Here are four things to consider when preparing your application: 1. Credit purpose When you apply for credit, the financial institution will want to know how you plan to use the money you borrow. Whether it\u2019s for equipment or inventory, you should have a clear understanding of why you need credit. In addition, make sure your credit request is practical. If you ask for more money than your business can realistically repay, the lender may deny your loan request or make a counteroffer for a lower amount. 2. Credit history Before making a credit decision, the lender will pull reports to review your personal and business credit history to find out if you have a history of making timely payments to your creditors and how much debt you have. Recent credit inquiries and interest-only mortgages may also affect a lender\u2019s credit decision. This information will help lenders determine whether you are a responsible borrower. If you have a weaker personal or business credit report, take steps to improve it. For example, you may want to accelerate paying down your existing credit or set up automatic payments to reduce your risk of late payments. 3. Company finances Your company\u2019s cash flow also plays a key role in your ability to get approved for credit. Lenders will look at how much revenue your business generates to ensure you can repay any additional debt. A lender may also request collateral \u2013 that could come in many forms such as business equipment or real estate. Make sure your company\u2019s financial data is accurate before submitting your credit application. 4. Application and accurate documentation Your application should be complete and free of errors.

Lower-cost payment processing Cash flow is the lifeblood of your business, but manually handling, processing, and dealing with cash, checks, and money orders can be costly and time-consuming. What\u2019s more, ShopifyPlus reported on a 41 percent increase in the number of real-time transactions from 2019 to 2020. By 2025, these digital instant payments are expected to make up nearly 20 percent of transactions. Meanwhile, a study by Blackhawk Network Global Digital Payments found that 54 percent of consumers surveyed will spend more money at a retailer where digital payments are allowed. To smooth the transition to accepting payments via mobile phones and wearable devices, consider investing in new payment systems. Also consider setting up recurring digital payments to your suppliers, vendors, utilities, and others, which is also a time-saver.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/digital-upgrades-that-can-strengthen-your-business-growth/"}

Mutually rewarding loyalty programs Loyalty programs have been found to strengthen bonds with existing customers and positively impact visit and sales figures: Recent research from Clarus Commerce shows that 87 percent of consumers who like a company\u2019s loyalty program will choose that company over a competitor with lower prices. Since the vast majority of consumers prefer rewards apps over punch cards, this is a great place to digitize. While loyalty programs do tend to require some maintenance, their advantages can make the effort worthwhile. Consider the following tips and tricks to help boost such a program\u2019s impact:\n\nKeep it simple. Put few limitations on program-eligible purchases and make the path to rewards short and clearly defined \u2014 especially for the first reward. Make it valuable. A free item or discount reward should be worth working toward. Not sure what would be most motivating? Ask a few prospects or customers. Spread the word. Commit to promoting the benefits via digital marketing channels and encourage program members to do the same.\n\nAs the digital marketplace increasingly becomes the norm, it\u2019s worth taking into account the potential benefits of online enhancements such as digital marketing, digital payments, and loyalty programs, and finding tangible steps for implementing these strategies.

Automated Clearing House (ACH) can help you digitize payroll and vendor payments, saving time and resources.\n\nWhat is ACH? ACH is a type of electronic payment that transfers funds between U.S. bank accounts through a network of financial institutions. Established in the 1970s, the ACH network enables you to digitally move funds between your own bank account and a vendor or employee bank account. Trillions of dollars route through ACH each year, including PayPal, Venmo, and Zelle\u00ae1 transactions. In fact, 2022 was a record year2 with more than 30 billion ACH payments, which averages about 90 payments per U.S. citizen.\n\nHow does ACH work? There are two types of ACH payments: credit and debit. ACH credit With an ACH credit, also known as a direct deposit, you \u201cpush\u201d funds from your bank account into an employee\u2019s or vendor\u2019s bank account. The payer initiates the transaction. It takes three steps:\n\nStep 1: Obtain the vendor or employee\u2019s name, bank name, account type, account number, and bank routing number. Step 2: Submit payment details through Wells Fargo Business Online\u00ae or Commercial Electronic Office\u00ae (CEO\u00ae) ACH that includes the account information and payment amount. Step 3: The funds are transferred from your account on the designated date.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/digitize-the-payment-process-with-ach/"}
{"id": "59cacc8ee750-1", "text": "For recurring payments, such as payroll, rent, or mortgage, you can set up automated ACH credits. ACH debit For an ACH debit, also known as a direct payment, money is \u201cpulled\u201d from one account to another. With the payer\u2019s permission, the recipient initiates the transaction to withdraw funds from the payer\u2019s account. The payer provides the recipient the same banking information as listed in Step 1 above. The recipient submits the payment file to their bank and pulls funds from your bank account. For example, you might set up automated ACH debit for your utility bills, which arrive monthly but vary in cost each month.\n\nHow can I use ACH? In 2022, there were more than 8 billion direct deposit ACH payments overall. One of the more familiar uses for ACH is for direct deposit of payroll3. But ACH has other useful applications for small businesses, too. For example, you can use ACH for:\n\nEmployee payments, such as reimbursed travel expenses or 401(k) contributions. Vendor payments, including those for suppliers, rent, or utilities. Government payments, such as tax payments and refunds, Social Security payments, and stimulus payments. Investment dividend and interest payments, including monthly payments.\n\nWhat are potential advantages of ACH? There are several advantages for your small business in using ACH payments.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/digitize-the-payment-process-with-ach/"}
{"id": "59cacc8ee750-2", "text": "Cost savings: ACH payments are less expensive compared to paper checks, credit card transactions, and wire transfers. Convenience: You will no longer need to take time printing, signing, and mailing paper checks, and making runs to the post office or bank. You can make ACH transactions from your office or while working remotely at home. The automated process makes it easy to schedule recurring payments, so there\u2019s no need to set a calendar reminder or keep track of paper invoices for these standard charges. Faster processing times: ACH payments can process as quickly as the same day or up to three days. That fast turnaround can help with your cash flow and let you know sooner if a payment from a vendor is declined. Security: ACH payments eliminate the need to mail paper checks, which are vulnerable to fraud. Your personal and account data are encrypted with each ACH transaction, for your protection. If there are any ACH errors, there are rules and regulations in place to help protect you. Consistency: By scheduling recurring ACH payments, you\u2019re creating a more consistent cash flow that\u2019s easier to forecast.\n\nHow do I get started making this type of transaction? It\u2019s easy to establish ACH payments for your small business. Talk to your banker today to find out how to set up ACH payments.

To efficiently move your products to customers, choosing the right distribution strategy is essential. The first step is understanding the key difference between direct and indirect distribution:\n\nDirect distribution means you take responsibility for delivering your goods into the hands of consumers. Many small business owners who are just launching their business use this method. Indirect distribution means enlisting a distributor to get your products to a retailer, who can sell on your behalf. As your business grows, this option may be more efficient and effective.\n\nWhat\u2019s right for your business? Compare the options: Pros and cons of direct distribution Whether it\u2019s done by a small business or a multinational company, direct distribution allows products to be sold directly to customers. On a micro scale, a jewelry maker selling small collections may choose to set up a website and sell directly to the public. On a larger scale, Apple sells directly to consumers through their Apple online store. Keep in mind that while direct distribution may offer advantages, there are also potential pitfalls when not using middlemen.\n\nPros: You have total control over how the product is marketed and sold, and there is no fighting with competitors for shelf space at retailers. Cons: Going it alone may be more time-consuming and expensive for some business owners, and you may have more limited market coverage.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/direct-vs-indirect-distribution-channels-whats-best-for-you/"}
{"id": "440164494d6c-1", "text": "Pros and cons of indirect distribution With indirect distribution, your small business sells wholesale to agents or retailers so that they can distribute the product for you. They store it, display it, and employ a sales force to market the product and ultimately get it into the hands of customers. As with direct distribution, though, there are positives and negatives.\n\nPros: Distribution agents specialize in getting products into as many markets as possible, and retailers know their local markets and how best to sell your product there. Cons: Distribution agents and retailers will share in your profits, and retailers may sell your competitors\u2019 products alongside yours.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/direct-vs-indirect-distribution-channels-whats-best-for-you/"}
{"id": "440164494d6c-2", "text": "Choosing a distribution strategy Determining the best method for getting your product to the consumer depends on what you\u2019re selling and how much you\u2019re willing to invest in distribution. In many cases, businesses use a blend of direct and indirect distribution methods that matches their needs and strategy. New small businesses generally don\u2019t have the capital to pursue multiple distribution avenues at the outset, so they need to choose one that fits, and stick with it while the business grows. Generally, if your product is perishable or if you\u2019re selling B2B, it\u2019s helpful to have fewer distribution channels between your point of manufacturing and your customer. In such cases, direct distribution may be best. If, however, you\u2019re aiming for a wider market with hopes of getting your products in front of as many consumers as possible, you may need to sell to distributors and let them handle this side of the business while you focus on making the product better or expanding your product line. If you do partner with distributors, do some vetting to ensure that you are working with a company that can serve your needs. The goal is to develop a long-lasting relationship. You\u2019re the product expert, but you\u2019re leveraging their sales expertise. Whatever your distribution strategy, it\u2019s smart to stay flexible and adjust your approach as your business changes.

Ms. Allen, in the past, you\u2019ve talked about lack of representation, and how this is a significant obstacle to Asian American business owners. Now, the question is how does this negatively affect businesses? Why is representation so important to you? I think representation in the United States Congress, where policies and laws are made that affect our daily lives is extremely important. Take a look at the last two years when COVID-19 blanketed the country with fear, economic and health devastation, and Asian Americans suffered an additional problem, anti-Asian discrimination and violence. We lost lives and property, and so much more. Two thirds of the crimes were perpetrated at places of business owned by Asian Americans.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}

Do me a favor. Can you tell us how some of the unique ways that are in place right now that affect Black businesses that might be different? Well, great question, Reggie. So often Black business issues get painted under the broad brush of minority programs. And what we asked for last year were three particular specific issues. One was intentionality. We wanted to be able to understand what was happening in the Black business community, versus that of minority programs. We have seen historically that it has been white women that have benefited from minority programs. About 78% of all of the federal government contracts were awarded to white women, versus those of Black business owners only received 1.67% of all of the federal government contracts. We\u2019re asking for three things, intentionality, transparency, and then thirdly, accountability. Diverse businesses were more", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}

Diverse businesses were more likely, compared to majority of white owned businesses, to experience financial and or operational challenges during the pandemic. Mr. Cavasos, why were Hispanic small diverse business owners especially challenged when it came to accessing funds, and what did you learn from that experience? Well, Reggie, there are 5 million Latino-owned businesses in America. Only 52% of those 5 million businesses had a banking relationship prior to COVID. And even before COVID they were challenged to get approval for lending, or more access to capital. A big part of the challenges of these small businesses once COVID hit was the fact that they have a lot of information. They needed more capacity to deliver their paperwork to the banks. A lot of our small businesses, our first or second generation businesses, are still very paper driven, and that\u2019s just the reality of mom and pop businesses. That\u2019s the American dream realized today. But many of these lenders could not access these small", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}

So some of our small business owners literally had to go to a bank and use the pneumatic tubes to get their paperwork to a banker so they could get their Paycheck Protection Program Loan approved. So that\u2019s a big reason why we waited for the the second round to really improve the system and expand it to small minority and women owned businesses, and meet them where they were. You know, in many ways I think the struggles of the pandemic actually haven\u2019t ended. Now we have inflation at a 40 year high, supply chain disruption, and labor shortages. Ms. Allen, we\u2019re gonna come to you first. How about for Asian American businesses during the pandemic? How is the outlook? Before the pandemic, Asian American businesses were on an upward trajectory. The Asian American community as a whole, was projected to reach $1.3 plus trillion dollars in GDP. The pandemic changed everything. Our businesses closed down faster", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}

So to answer your question, Reggie, the outlook for the future is bright, because our persistence, I believe in our own hard work that many Americans do as well. So Mr. Busby, what struggles ahead do you see for diverse business owners now that they\u2019ve come through these two years, and not that it\u2019s over, but what do you see the struggles now? You know, for years, we\u2019ve been going to corporate America as well as the federal government saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019d like to do more business with your entity.\u201d We\u2019re trying to remove any type of barrier that will allow us, or continue to keep us out of", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}

I think there\u2019s another topic I\u2019d love to explore, and it\u2019s about financial education. Because the reality is diverse business owners statistically are less likely to seek capital, even among firms with good credit.

If you look at the industries in which we over index, usually those are the businesses that have a more cash and carry relationship. And so under times like COVID, where we were told to go to a bank to get your finances taken care of, and many Black-owned businesses did not have that relationship. And so we\u2019re asking our business owners a couple of things. Establish your banking relationships now, because there\u2019s always going to be another pandemic. It could just be your social media page being hacked. It could be you lost your debit card. We\u2019ve gotta make sure that we have relationships where the bankers, and not just a teller, not just a branch manager, but the banking decision makers understand who you are, where you want to go, and some of the challenges that you\u2019re facing to be able to help you get there long-term. Ms. Allen, if you don\u2019t mind, what are Asian American business owners", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-11", "text": "you don\u2019t mind, what are Asian American business owners lacking as far as financial literacy, and what can banks and business owners do about it? In general, there are two groups of Asian Americans in terms of financial literacy. There are those who are educated and have been investing and saving, and know how to handle their money. There are those who don\u2019t. And let me talk about those who do not. They are Asian Americans, are savers. They do put their money under their mattress. They do. And that\u2019s why during the pandemic, if they were asked to show their account, the books, they can\u2019t. And the other thing is cultural differences and language barriers. There\u2019s a lot of business out there. The financial institution just need to know where to go, how to knock, and how to approach them. Mr. Cavasos, can you tell us how being on a bank board actually opened your eyes to how lending works, and why it\u2019s important to have Latinos and Latinas represented at those tables?", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-12", "text": "to have Latinos and Latinas represented at those tables? I had the honor of serving on a bank board. I was the only Latino. It was a community bank, and I was on the loan committee and had no preconceived notions. And, but serving on the loan committee, I saw that there were Latino-owned businesses that applied for a small business loan who had a higher credit score that were denied, or they had a repayment history that was stronger than a non-Latino, or as we say in Texas an Anglo-owned business. And I literally had to raise my hand at those loan committee meetings and say, \u201cWhy did that get approved, and this one didn\u2019t get approved?\u201d So I learned at a very young age to be open, to be transparent, to be vocal, not to be in any way argumentative, but to in essence clear the decks for small business owners. When I see sometimes people are doing as they try to form the very relationships with something that may not even be present", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-13", "text": "very relationships with something that may not even be present in their spaces, they don\u2019t know where to go unless there\u2019s a program that says, \u201cIt may not be one in your neighborhood, but here\u2019s what you can still do.\u201d People need to be a part of a network. And for some small businesses, they don\u2019t always recognize the importance of networking. So, Ms. Allen, can you tell us about some of the programs at USPAC and how they are addressing specific challenges that members have? Asian Americans tend to be quiet and keep to their own business. But the major challenge at the very front is that Asian Americans are still considered foreigners. I see the big word behind you, Reggie. We don\u2019t belong. We do not feel that we not belong. My job as the chief executive and national president of the U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce Education Foundation, together with our regional chapters in California, Texas, Georgia, Illinois, and New Jersey, the five states with the most critical", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}

Mr. Cavasos, can you tell us about the the 3 Cs that you talk about, and why those are important? And, how does the chamber help members develop in those areas? There\u2019s no question that Hispanics have been under capitalized for years, or turned down due to discrimination. We would have an additional $2.5 trillion dollars in the U.S. economy if the under capitalized Latino-owned businesses were able to receive lending at the same level as non-Latinos in this country. So capital is vital for scaling firms, growing mom and pop businesses. We\u2019ve seen where it makes a difference to open a second location or a third location to a successful business. Access to capacity building. They need the tools that they need to get ready to apply for a loan, to do a marketing plan, to", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}

Less than 1% of the U.S. government\u2019s federal contracts go to Hispanic-owned businesses. We have realized because of the pandemic that we are so interconnected more so than we ever imagined before, we need one another to be successful entrepreneurs. And we\u2019ve learned that our net worth as businesses and business owners is our network. I want to transition just to one other thing, and it\u2019s, you know, Mr. Busby, do something for me. Can you tell us about the ways you reach out to Black-owned businesses through media or mentorship, and why that is important right now? I think we are at a point now where it\u2019s really about economic parity, about moving an economic agenda for Black people. And like I say, in order for there to be a great America, there\u2019s got to be great minority America. And in order to have great minority America, you gotta have great minority", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-16", "text": "great minority America, you gotta have great minority businesses. And in order to have great minority owned businesses, you have to have great minority chamber leaders. And so I\u2019m excited about sharing my role as a president of the U.S. Black Chamber with Ramiro, as Susan, both sharing their roles of leading their communities as well as their businesses across the country. So here\u2019s what we know to be true. We all need to network. We know the importance of networking. For some people, it\u2019s frustrating. For other people, they love it. The reality is though, is that networking with peers is equally as important for mentoring and growing businesses. But there are a lot of barriers to diverse owners. So, Ms. Allen, how do you advise your members to knock down these networking barriers and be more effective networkers? Well, you know, for a long time, I\u2019ve always told this story, but not heard enough among Asian American businesses, that they are the one", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-17", "text": "among Asian American businesses, that they are the one shrimp cocktail party goer. And I go to the buffet table, pick up a shrimp cocktail, eat it, and drop the drink, and leave. They don\u2019t stay around to network. And they\u2019ve lost all that opportunity to create a network of their own. Watch the news, watch world news, national news, domestic news, pick up the magazine when you\u2019re at the doctor\u2019s office and read the headlines. Get to know what\u2019s going on around you. So then when you go to a networking event, you will understand what you have to say, because you will have all that content, assets inside of you. You\u2019ll be very comfortable. Building on that, Mr. Busby, what do you have to say about what does good networking look like? I live in Bowie, Maryland, and I tell the story all the time. I bought a home. I used a Black realtor. I used a Black bank. I used a Black mortgage company. I used a Black", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-18", "text": "used a Black mortgage company. I used a Black moving company. I used a Black home inspector. I used a Black installation company. Everyone that touched the transaction was Black. I was telling that story at an event. There were 25 young Black men that all used to meet on Friday mornings at 6:00 AM. And they would get together to network, to really share information, to create best practices for them to move their individual companies. I said, \u201cBut what you don\u2019t know is what you don\u2019t know.\u201d They didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t have the understanding of banking relationships. And so on a Friday morning, we took all 25 young Black men down to the bank, in their suits and ties, to make sure that they understood the importance of networking together, but more importantly having outsiders tell them best practices of things, and policies, and ideas that they might not have had on their own. So there\u2019s a couple of things that have been on my mind, and really it\u2019s banks like Wells", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-19", "text": "on my mind, and really it\u2019s banks like Wells Fargo that are doing their part to push things forward. Even in the work that I do, I tell small business owners, or marginalized populations, that one of the things you have to do is focus, like where do you spend your energy? So if you think about that energy, action, impact, momentum in order to get to progress, I\u2019m asking you, this elite panel, where do you think small business owners should focus their energy and their time? And Mr. Cavasos, I\u2019ll start with you. Well, Reggie, it\u2019s been an honor to be here with you and Wells Fargo. And we tell our small Hispanic-owned businesses, that no matter what product that they make or what service they provide, that their focus should be on people. We\u2019re all in the people business no matter what we do. And so part of networking, part of building a small business into a multi-billion dollar business is to be focused on your customer, what their needs are,", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-20", "text": "be focused on your customer, what their needs are, and what their focus should be. Okay, Ms. Allen, what do you have? What\u2019s that piece of advice? COVID-19 has changed a whole lot, turned the world upside down, changed the way we do business, we live, we socialize, and we conduct business. What we did in 20 and 21 are testing the ground. In 2022, we\u2019re beginning to sit back and see and say, \u201cWhat did we do in 2020 and 2021 that\u2019s a waste? And what did we do that is going to be useful that would take us forward?\u201d That\u2019s what I would tell my small business to do. Mr. Busby, what do you think, what\u2019s that piece of advice that you wanna share with a small business owner? Where should they focus? Great question. And I\u2019ll end with, if I was a small business owner, which I was more than half my life, and had a father that had a small business, and he used to say, \u201cSpend more time working", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-21", "text": "and he used to say, \u201cSpend more time working on your business, versus working in your business.\u201d So many small business owners are doing the day to day grind, trying to make sure that they can pay their bills, that they very seldom have the time to really look at the future of what that business may be. So I would tell business owners to make sure that they\u2019re working on their business as much as they are working in it. So thank you, Ron, Susan, and Ramiro for sharing your insights with us. You know, the last two years, I\u2019ll admit have been difficult for many diverse small businesses, but as we\u2019ve discussed their challenges are more systemic and go back far before 2020.

Small businesses are the backbone of the economy, making up nearly half of the workforce in the private sector. Within that, diverse businesses are among the fastest growing segment. Yet, despite their importance to the economy diverse small businesses have historically faced numerous systemic challenges that have created obstacles to their success. Then the pandemic added to these challenges, disproportionately impacting diverse owners who two years on continue to struggle against inflation, labor shortages, and supply chain disruption. Supporting small businesses is crucially important to Wells Fargo in understanding the challenges they face and the support they need is the first step to providing that support. Digging into these topics today is our esteemed panel from the Pan Asian American, Black, and Hispanic Chambers of Commerce. First, we have Susan Allen.

Looking forward to the conversation today. Let\u2019s dive in and start with the big picture. Diverse businesses are so important to the American economy. Yet so many of these owners face significant challenges. So, Mr. Cavasos, why is representation important to Hispanic businesses? Why does that matter? Well, it matters because our economy depends on diverse businesses, or else we will not stay the largest economy and the strongest economy in the world. And so for us, you know, we need", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}

And so for us, you know, we need to be at the table, not just because it\u2019s good social corporate responsibility, it\u2019s an economic imperative that Black, Brown, Asian, LGBTQ businesses, all of us within our chamber are represented, but that we\u2019re also present at those decision making tables. Ms. Allen, in the past, you\u2019ve talked about lack of representation, and how this is a significant obstacle to Asian American business owners. Now, the question is how does this negatively affect businesses? Why is representation so important to you? I think representation in the United States Congress, where policies and laws are made that affect our daily lives is extremely important. Take a look at the last two years when COVID-19 blanketed the country with fear, economic and health devastation, and Asian Americans suffered an additional problem, anti-Asian discrimination and violence. We lost lives and property, and so much more. Two thirds of the crimes were perpetrated at places of business owned by Asian Americans.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}

Do me a favor. Can you tell us how some of the unique ways that are in place right now that affect Black businesses that might be different? Well, great question, Reggie. So often Black business issues get painted under the broad brush of minority programs. And what we asked for last year were three particular specific issues. One was intentionality. We wanted to be able to understand what was happening in the Black business community, versus that of minority programs. We have seen historically that it has been white women that have benefited from minority programs. About 78% of all of the federal government contracts were awarded to white women, versus those of Black business owners only received 1.67% of all of the federal government contracts. We\u2019re asking for three things, intentionality, transparency, and then thirdly, accountability. Diverse businesses were more", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-6", "text": "then thirdly, accountability. Diverse businesses were more likely, compared to majority of white owned businesses, to experience financial and or operational challenges during the pandemic. Mr. Cavasos, why were Hispanic small diverse business owners especially challenged when it came to accessing funds, and what did you learn from that experience? Well, Reggie, there are 5 million Latino-owned businesses in America. Only 52% of those 5 million businesses had a banking relationship prior to COVID. And even before COVID they were challenged to get approval for lending, or more access to capital. A big part of the challenges of these small businesses once COVID hit was the fact that they have a lot of information. They needed more capacity to deliver their paperwork to the banks. A lot of our small businesses, our first or second generation businesses, are still very paper driven, and that\u2019s just the reality of mom and pop businesses. That\u2019s the American dream realized today. But many of these lenders could not access these small", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-7", "text": "But many of these lenders could not access these small businesses. So some of our small business owners literally had to go to a bank and use the pneumatic tubes to get their paperwork to a banker so they could get their Paycheck Protection Program Loan approved. So that\u2019s a big reason why we waited for the the second round to really improve the system and expand it to small minority and women owned businesses, and meet them where they were. You know, in many ways I think the struggles of the pandemic actually haven\u2019t ended. Now we have inflation at a 40 year high, supply chain disruption, and labor shortages. Ms. Allen, we\u2019re gonna come to you first. How about for Asian American businesses during the pandemic? How is the outlook? Before the pandemic, Asian American businesses were on an upward trajectory. The Asian American community as a whole, was projected to reach $1.3 plus trillion dollars in GDP. The pandemic changed everything. Our businesses closed down faster", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-8", "text": "pandemic changed everything. Our businesses closed down faster than any other ethnic groups, 40%, 60% across the country, and 90% in Los Angeles and New York, the biggest drop in business revenue in the country. Devastating, but 70% of Asian American community is consisted of immigrants, and sons and daughters of immigrants. That\u2019s why we are so independent. So to answer your question, Reggie, the outlook for the future is bright, because our persistence, I believe in our own hard work that many Americans do as well. So Mr. Busby, what struggles ahead do you see for diverse business owners now that they\u2019ve come through these two years, and not that it\u2019s over, but what do you see the struggles now? You know, for years, we\u2019ve been going to corporate America as well as the federal government saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019d like to do more business with your entity.\u201d We\u2019re trying to remove any type of barrier that will allow us, or continue to keep us out of", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}

You can be certified as a Black-owned business, and for corporates as well as individuals and federal government agencies you can find Black-owned businesses. You know, it\u2019s inspiring to hear this collection of I\u2019m gonna call you advocates and allies all at the same time, as we\u2019re pushing things forward. I think there\u2019s another topic I\u2019d love to explore, and it\u2019s about financial education. Because the reality is diverse business owners statistically are less likely to seek capital, even among firms with good credit. Mr. Busby, you\u2019ve mentioned in the past that Black entrepreneurs are sometimes taught to do things that don\u2019t adequately prepare them when it comes to applying for financing. So what are some of the areas that Black entrepreneurs need to know", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-10", "text": "of the areas that Black entrepreneurs need to know about when it comes to financing? If you look at the industries in which we over index, usually those are the businesses that have a more cash and carry relationship. And so under times like COVID, where we were told to go to a bank to get your finances taken care of, and many Black-owned businesses did not have that relationship. And so we\u2019re asking our business owners a couple of things. Establish your banking relationships now, because there\u2019s always going to be another pandemic. It could just be your social media page being hacked. It could be you lost your debit card. We\u2019ve gotta make sure that we have relationships where the bankers, and not just a teller, not just a branch manager, but the banking decision makers understand who you are, where you want to go, and some of the challenges that you\u2019re facing to be able to help you get there long-term. Ms. Allen, if you don\u2019t mind, what are Asian American business owners", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-11", "text": "you don\u2019t mind, what are Asian American business owners lacking as far as financial literacy, and what can banks and business owners do about it? In general, there are two groups of Asian Americans in terms of financial literacy. There are those who are educated and have been investing and saving, and know how to handle their money. There are those who don\u2019t. And let me talk about those who do not. They are Asian Americans, are savers. They do put their money under their mattress. They do. And that\u2019s why during the pandemic, if they were asked to show their account, the books, they can\u2019t. And the other thing is cultural differences and language barriers. There\u2019s a lot of business out there. The financial institution just need to know where to go, how to knock, and how to approach them. Mr. Cavasos, can you tell us how being on a bank board actually opened your eyes to how lending works, and why it\u2019s important to have Latinos and Latinas represented at those tables?", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-12", "text": "to have Latinos and Latinas represented at those tables? I had the honor of serving on a bank board. I was the only Latino. It was a community bank, and I was on the loan committee and had no preconceived notions. And, but serving on the loan committee, I saw that there were Latino-owned businesses that applied for a small business loan who had a higher credit score that were denied, or they had a repayment history that was stronger than a non-Latino, or as we say in Texas an Anglo-owned business. And I literally had to raise my hand at those loan committee meetings and say, \u201cWhy did that get approved, and this one didn\u2019t get approved?\u201d So I learned at a very young age to be open, to be transparent, to be vocal, not to be in any way argumentative, but to in essence clear the decks for small business owners. When I see sometimes people are doing as they try to form the very relationships with something that may not even be present", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}

And for some small businesses, they don\u2019t always recognize the importance of networking. So, Ms. Allen, can you tell us about some of the programs at USPAC and how they are addressing specific challenges that members have? Asian Americans tend to be quiet and keep to their own business. But the major challenge at the very front is that Asian Americans are still considered foreigners. I see the big word behind you, Reggie. We don\u2019t belong. We do not feel that we not belong. My job as the chief executive and national president of the U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce Education Foundation, together with our regional chapters in California, Texas, Georgia, Illinois, and New Jersey, the five states with the most critical", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}

Mr. Cavasos, can you tell us about the the 3 Cs that you talk about, and why those are important? And, how does the chamber help members develop in those areas? There\u2019s no question that Hispanics have been under capitalized for years, or turned down due to discrimination. We would have an additional $2.5 trillion dollars in the U.S. economy if the under capitalized Latino-owned businesses were able to receive lending at the same level as non-Latinos in this country. So capital is vital for scaling firms, growing mom and pop businesses. We\u2019ve seen where it makes a difference to open a second location or a third location to a successful business.

We have realized because of the pandemic that we are so interconnected more so than we ever imagined before, we need one another to be successful entrepreneurs. And we\u2019ve learned that our net worth as businesses and business owners is our network. I want to transition just to one other thing, and it\u2019s, you know, Mr. Busby, do something for me. Can you tell us about the ways you reach out to Black-owned businesses through media or mentorship, and why that is important right now? I think we are at a point now where it\u2019s really about economic parity, about moving an economic agenda for Black people.

So here\u2019s what we know to be true. We all need to network. We know the importance of networking. For some people, it\u2019s frustrating. For other people, they love it. The reality is though, is that networking with peers is equally as important for mentoring and growing businesses. But there are a lot of barriers to diverse owners. So, Ms. Allen, how do you advise your members to knock down these networking barriers and be more effective networkers? Well, you know, for a long time, I\u2019ve always told this story, but not heard enough among Asian American businesses, that they are the one", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}

So then when you go to a networking event, you will understand what you have to say, because you will have all that content, assets inside of you. You\u2019ll be very comfortable. Building on that, Mr. Busby, what do you have to say about what does good networking look like? I live in Bowie, Maryland, and I tell the story all the time. I bought a home. I used a Black realtor.

I said, \u201cBut what you don\u2019t know is what you don\u2019t know.\u201d They didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t have the understanding of banking relationships. And so on a Friday morning, we took all 25 young Black men down to the bank, in their suits and ties, to make sure that they understood the importance of networking together, but more importantly having outsiders tell them best practices of things, and policies, and ideas that they might not have had on their own.

So if you think about that energy, action, impact, momentum in order to get to progress, I\u2019m asking you, this elite panel, where do you think small business owners should focus their energy and their time? And Mr. Cavasos, I\u2019ll start with you. Well, Reggie, it\u2019s been an honor to be here with you and Wells Fargo. And we tell our small Hispanic-owned businesses, that no matter what product that they make or what service they provide, that their focus should be on people. We\u2019re all in the people business no matter what we do.

Whether you\u2019re running a brand-new startup looking for its first bank loan or an established company seeking high-impact investment dollars, access to capital can be a stumbling block. For fast-growing companies, angel or venture capital (VC) investors may be promising options. But these hard-charging investors aren\u2019t the right fit for every company. Here\u2019s what you need to know about them and how to prepare if you think your business might be a good candidate.\n\nHow VC and angel investing work Angel investors typically provide financial backing for startups with interesting ideas while VC investors seek out businesses with growth potential. They differ mainly in whose money they are using: Angel investors are usually high-net-worth individuals who are investing their own money, while venture capitalists (VCs) are typically professionals who work for a fund that pools other investors\u2019 money. Angels and VCs take some percentage of the business\u2019s equity in exchange for a certain amount of funding, which means that these investors own a portion of the company. They expect a large return on their investments. As a result, this funding typically comes with high investor expectations and involvement. Investors usually lay out specific growth benchmarks and usually expect to see a return within three to five years. In addition, many VC and angel investors expect to be involved in decision-making.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse-owned-business-and-venture-capital-investment/"}
{"id": "7ec106360fe4-1", "text": "Is angel or VC funding right for you? The most important factors in deciding whether you should pursue this kind of funding is how fast your company is able to grow and how much room it has to scale. VC and angel investors are looking for high-growth companies, so if your trajectory is slower or smaller, look elsewhere for funding. And remember: Just because your company can scale fast doesn\u2019t mean doing so is right for you. With angel or VC funding, your company must be ready to put a large amount of money to good use quickly. Also remember that the process of seeking it out is time-consuming, typically taking founders weeks or months of full-time work. It\u2019s worth noting that women and people of color are underrepresented among both funders and funded startups, though the industry is seeking to change that. In 2020, only $1 billion of the almost $150 billion in venture capital raised by U.S. companies went to startups founded by Black entrepreneurs of any gender.1 Various angels and VC firms are actively working to diversify funded companies. In another example, a new St. Louis \u2013 based $25 million VC fund will prioritize funding startups founded by people of color.2\n\nHow to pursue angel or VC funding Don\u2019t just introduce lenders to your business: Let them get to know you, too. Use a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to show, through concrete examples, that you have the experience to run a thriving business and manage the loan well. While these details may not directly affect a lender\u2019s decision on your loan, they can help you build relationships with your banker.\n\nSeek out potential funders. Find promising connections via LinkedIn, introductions from colleagues, industry events, and social media, especially Twitter. Register with Crunchbase, a popular source of leads for angels and VCs. Connect with VCs interested in diverse founders via industry networking groups and diversity initiatives.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse-owned-business-and-venture-capital-investment/"}

Include an overview of your industry and your company\u2019s place in it and describe your marketing objectives. Include up-to-date financial projections to show the potential for growth.\n\nWrite your elevator pitch. Include a short, powerful description of your business to catch investors\u2019 interest. Use as few words as you can to get across the power of your idea. And avoid too much background or context; instead, quickly explain the problem you\u2019re solving and then dive right into how you\u2019re approaching it in a novel way.\n\nCreate a pitch deck. This should be succinct; industry insiders suggest you stick to 10 slides total.3 Include information on the strength of your team and financials that illustrate the potential for scale. Explain specifically how you will use the investment money to grow.\n\nIf you execute all the previous steps well, you may soon receive an invitation to meet and/or pitch to an investor. Think ahead about what questions to ask, such as the amount of funding on offer, the equity the funder is seeking, and the length of time they anticipate investing. Other questions to consider are:4\n\nWhat percentage of the fund does this investment account for? (The higher the better, as the investor will have more incentive to help you succeed.)\n\nHow often does the fund follow on with more funding in the next rounds?\n\nWhat are the fund\u2019s reporting requirements?\n\nWhat will the due diligence process be like?\n\nHow much interaction will the business have with the funder\u2019s team?", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse-owned-business-and-venture-capital-investment/"}

For small business owners with big ambitions, angel and VC funding can be powerful options to help your business grow and thrive. Just be aware that these investors are looking for businesses with the potential to scale, and that receiving funding from them comes with some serious strings attached. If you believe your company is a good fit for this kind of funding, network assertively, create a succinct pitch, and ask probing questions before moving forward. 1.

It is a key indicator of the financial health of your business. A consistent, positive cash flow can help you pay expenses, invest in new opportunities, and grow your business. Below are some cash flow management strategies to consider: 1. Pay bills strategically Extend payables as long as possible and spread your payments. Don\u2019t pay all your business bills at the same time. This can drain your cash and potentially jeopardize your relationships with suppliers if you are unable to pay. Instead, review bills, sort according to priority, and stagger payment dates so the most important bills \u2014 such as rent and payroll \u2014 are paid first. Payments that are less important and more flexible can be made later. However, be sure to pay on time to avoid late charges. Also, check if you can receive discounts for paying any bills early, and then prioritize the ones that qualify. 2.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/eight-tips-for-small-business-cash-flow-management/"}
{"id": "0e1f8890ecc0-2", "text": "and then prioritize the ones that qualify. 2. Choose the right payroll cycle Structure your payroll to mesh with your revenue stream and comply with wage and hour laws. Businesses that generate daily revenue, such as restaurants and retail, can more easily cover the cash needed for weekly payroll. But this can be a challenge for businesses with slower revenue streams, such as manufacturers or wholesalers, because cash doesn\u2019t come in as frequently. There may be a benefit to holding the cash to be paid less frequently than weekly, e.g. biweekly or monthly, provided applicable wage and hour law permits you to do so. Check with your state Department of Labor on any requirements for payroll frequency. 3. Negotiate your payments with suppliers Using suppliers with low prices may seem like the best way to improve cash flow, but flexible payment options can be more important than bottom-shelf pricing. Ask your suppliers about their payment terms. You may be able to time your payments with your cash inflows. 4.

{"id": "0e1f8890ecc0-4", "text": "Request deposits from your customers when taking orders. Offer discounted prices strategically to move outdated inventory. Offer discounts to customers who pay quickly. Consider online invoices, as well as provide online payment options.\n\n5. Manage your credit policies carefully If you offer credit to customers, stand firm on your credit policies to make sure you get the cash you need. Try these strategies:\n\nSend invoices promptly, verify they\u2019ve been received, and follow up right away on late payments. Require a credit check for all new customers before extending credit. Monitor your accounts to identify late-paying customers and implement a cash-on-delivery policy for chronic offenders.\n\n6. Use a business credit card. Consider using a business credit card to pay for everyday expenses to free up cash. Then keep track of those expenses with online banking and your monthly statements. Also, take advantage of any rewards programs that can reduce your expenses, such as a certain percentage cash back on some purchases. 7. Consider a line of credit Having a line of credit provides quick access to funds when needed and can help maintain a balanced cash flow cycle. A line of credit can be used to bridge gaps between payables and receivables, buy equipment, cover seasonal or unexpected expenses, or to take advantage of growth opportunities. 8. Use technology to make and accept payments Accept online payments to collect receivables faster and use electronic fund transfers to automatically pay bills on the last day they\u2019re due. Technology should also help you keep track of where you stand. Positive cash flow is critical to your short- and long-term financial success. Make the most of your cash by monitoring expenses, collecting payments quickly, and using resources that can make your cash flow management more convenient.\n\nArticle\n\nYou might also like\n\nUsing credit to stabilize your cash flow\n\nHere's how the right credit products can help level things out.\n\nMinimize your operating cycle to free up cash during growth", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/eight-tips-for-small-business-cash-flow-management/"}

Whether your business is just starting up or preparing for expansion, credit can help support your short- and long-term financial goals. You\u2019ll find there are a number of benefits to having business credit. However, before you apply, it\u2019s important to determine whether your business is ready for credit. Follow these steps to ensure your business is fully prepared to obtain financing: Review your credit history When assessing creditworthiness, both your personal and business finances matter. On the business side, a bank will determine if your business is generating a positive cash flow. On the personal side, a bank will want to know if you are generating enough income to support not only your current debt, but also the debt that you\u2019re requesting. Before you approach a lender, request a copy of your personal credit report and your business credit report, and review them carefully for accuracy. If you spot an error, file an online dispute with the three credit reporting agencies within 30 days of receiving your report. Gather financial documents Before filling out your application, locate this information and double-check it for accuracy:\n\nBusiness revenue reports Personal income reports Tax returns for the past three years Asset and bank account information Proof of ownership The correct legal name of the business", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/five-steps-to-consider-before-applying-for-credit/"}
{"id": "88aaa46b9939-1", "text": "Providing comprehensive and accurate information can help your application move through the process as quickly as possible. Determine how much capital you need Be prepared to tell the lender how you plan to use the money. For example, you may explain that you will use the capital to pay for additional office space and furniture or for a website redesign. Also be sure you are asking for a realistic amount to fulfill those particular goals. Construction materials, for example, have been impacted by recent supply chain issues, which has driven up costs \u2014 so a remodeling project this year may be considerably costlier than the quote you got two years ago. If you\u2019re not sure how much capital to request, consider seeking bids from several companies before filling out your loan application. This information will help your financial professional determine whether your business is currently able to take on the debt required to fund such improvements. Understand all your lending options It\u2019s important to identify all the lending options available to you and determine which one is the best choice for your business. You will also want to consider the process and the timing. For example, loan decisions below $100,000 may be based on your credit profile and basic information, while larger amounts may require a detailed review of your finances. Some things to keep in mind:\n\nCredit cards may be used for everyday purchases, including office supplies, meals, and travel. Lines of credit can help with working capital needs (such as paying for inventory) and maintaining cash flow. Term loans are designed for making specific purchases, such as equipment, vehicles, real estate, or renovations.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/five-steps-to-consider-before-applying-for-credit/"}
{"id": "88aaa46b9939-2", "text": "If you\u2019re unsure which credit product is right for your needs, discuss it in detail with your banker before you apply. Consider terms and interest rates You also have to decide how long you will need to repay your credit. There are short-, medium-, and long-term loans, and they all have positives and negatives. For example, if you expect to be able to pay back the money quickly, a short-term loan may be the best choice. Interest rates can also have a big impact on your decision. For example, loans with fixed interest rates may make it easier for you to budget, as you\u2019ll likely have fixed monthly payments. Bottom line: Just as planning and preparation can help you set the business goals that will help you succeed, planning and preparation can help you apply for and secure the funds needed to reach them. This is a good time to consult your accountant and/or financial advisor, who can explain the various trade-offs of loans and credit products \u2014 and how their rates and terms can impact you now and in the future.\n\nArticle\n\nYou might also like\n\nApplying for business credit: What happens after I apply?\n\nA credit application will go through several stages of review.\n\nWe\u2019re here to help\n\nProducts & services tailored to your business needs Get started\n\nTalk with a banker\n\nMake an appointment\n\nAdditional resources\n\nSolutions for Women Entrepreneurs Resources tailored to the needs of women-led businesses, designed to help you succeed.\n\nDiverse Business Resources Discover tools, resources, and guidance to help you achieve your goals.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nSolutions for Women Entrepreneurs Resources tailored to the needs of women-led businesses, designed to help you succeed.\n\nDiverse Business Resources Discover tools, resources, and guidance to help you achieve your goals.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/five-steps-to-consider-before-applying-for-credit/"}

But financing isn\u2019t always easy to get: In 2021, only 31% of Asian and Hispanic business owners and 19% of Black business owners had sufficient funding to run their business, compared to 50% of white business owners.1 But Black-owned firms were only half as likely as white-owned firms to get full approval for loans, lines of credit, and cash advances.2 Building a solid business credit history can improve the odds of receiving financing. Here are five key elements to address as you build your business credit:\n\n1A formal business entity\n\nIt\u2019s important to establish a separate business entity that can establish its own credit history\n\nIncorporate your business by registering it to establish a separate legal entity such as an LLC, S-corporation, or LLP It\u2019s usually a good idea to apply for an employer identification number (EIN) from the IRS to establish additional separation between your business and personal finances, even if one isn\u2019t required. You should consult a tax or legal professional to help ensure you choose the right form of incorporation for your business.\n\n2A business banking relationship\n\nLoans are by far the most common form of financing, sought by 76% of businesses.3\n\nLike establishing a corporation, opening a business bank account helps establish a business as an independent entity.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/good-business-credit-and-diverse-business/"}
{"id": "882139443793-1", "text": "Like establishing a corporation, opening a business bank account helps establish a business as an independent entity.\n\nWhile business lenders may not specifically require you to have a business bank account, it could ease the process of applying for \u2014 and paying down \u2014 a loan or line of credit. Having an existing financial relationship with a bank could make the process more efficient.\n\n3Trade credit\n\nOpening trade lines with your vendors can help build your business credit. Here are three important steps you can take.\n\nTalk to your vendors about opening a line of credit. Check with vendors to be sure they report their credit arrangements to the major credit bureaus. Submitting trade references to Dun & Bradstreet, which tracks business credit, can also help ensure your trade relationships are captured properly so they can help build your business credit.\n\n4On\n\n\n\ntime payments\n\nJust as with personal credit, an established history of on-time payments creates a track record for your business that can make lenders more willing to extend business credit.\n\n15% of all business-to-business payments are made late.4\n\nNotifications of late or missed payments can harm your business credit score. Make all of your business payments on time or early, if possible. If you know you\u2019ll need more time to make a payment, speak with the affected vendor or lender right away to work out a payment plan.\n\n5Monitoring your business credit score\n\nTo ensure your efforts to improve your business credit are working, it\u2019s important to monitor your score regularly.\n\n20% of small business loans are denied due to poor business credit.5 By building and maintaining solid business credit, you raise the chances your business will get the funding it needs to grow and thrive.\n\nTrack your score across the major business credit bureaus:\n\nDun & Bradstreet\n\nExperian\n\nEquifax\n\nCorrect any errors immediately by contacting the credit bureau and filing a formal dispute.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/good-business-credit-and-diverse-business/"}

As an entrepreneur, finding a small business mentor or sponsorship can be the key to reaching new levels of success. Studies show that diverse-owned businesses are more likely to lack access to a professional network that can connect to crucial resources like capital.1 These relationships matter. According to a 2021 Small Business Credit survey by the Federal Reserve, diverse small business owners were more likely than white-owned firms to report poor or fair financial conditions. The majority, or 79% of Asian-owned firms and 77% of Black-owned firms, reported fair or poor financial conditions compared to 54% of their white counterparts.2 One way to combat these disparities is to pursue small business sponsorships and mentorships. Sponsors and mentors are similar, but slightly different relationships; both can help business owners. Whether you\u2019re a business enterprise seeking guidance or in a position to provide it, here are some tips on how to expand your network through these relationships. Networks can be a catalyst for beneficial business partnerships and access to capital, ultimately helping business owners build financial resilience.\n\nWhat is the difference between a mentor and a sponsor? Mentorship centers around guidance such as coaching, goal setting, or accountability. Sponsorship includes mentorship plus resources like access to capital, key relationships, and influence to support key business endeavors.3", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/how-mentorship-and-sponsorship-can-help-business/"}
{"id": "724421b64280-1", "text": "What does an ideal mentorship relationship look like? There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to mentorship. Providing advice, guidance, and goal setting is a great start. An ideal mentor is a seasoned professional in your industry who wants to pass on what they\u2019ve learned. Mentors with special expertise can provide insight on critical topics like taxation, raising capital, scaling, marketing, technology, and more.\n\nTip: Understand what you need\n\nThese relationships tend to be informal, so it helps to know what areas you need the most help in so you can seek it out. It\u2019s also a plus to find someone who relates to or understands your challenges as a diverse business owner. Small business owners looking for a mentor should also understand the kind of commitment they are looking for. Assess how much support and time your mentor can provide. Think about how often or where meetings can take place. Traditional mentoring relationships are one on one, but it could also be calls or at industry events.\n\nWhat does an ideal sponsorship relationship look like? Sponsorship is very much like a mentorship with added benefits. Sponsors may also provide capital, help with credentials like certifications, advocate on your behalf, or provide connections. These resources can be a catalyst for businesses to reach financial and growth milestones much faster than they would without a sponsor. Traditional sponsorship typically involves money in exchange for promotion. Sponsorships are not easy to find, but can come from many sources, including larger competitors, vendors, clients, or anyone willing to vouch for you.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/how-mentorship-and-sponsorship-can-help-business/"}
{"id": "724421b64280-2", "text": "How can diverse business owners find a sponsor or mentor? Start with your personal network and reach out. Next, attend networking events in your industry. This could include conferences, Facebook groups, or mastermind cohorts. You might also check out industry forums, local community groups, or your church or other religious organization (if that\u2019s a part of your network), and connect with established professionals on social media as appropriate. Another valuable resource is your local SCORE branch, which has mentorship opportunities specifically for Black, Latino, and Asian American business owners. Large corporations sometimes host formal mentorship and sponsorship programs and post updated information about these efforts on their websites. These programs may be part of supplier diversity programs.\n\nTip: Boost your online presence\n\nAs you do outreach, make sure that you\u2019ve got a public-facing profile, such as on LinkedIn, so your contacts have something to reference. When you broadcast your businesses\u2019 activities, you are letting potential sponsors know that you are already active in your industry, which might inspire them to help you.\n\nMake the ask Once you find a potential sponsor or mentor, make the ask. For mentorships, it\u2019s important to form a relationship first. If you\u2019re discussing a sponsorship and money or something else of value will be exchanged, create written documentation such as a promissory note or assignment of shares when exchanging equity for capital. Keep at it. Expanding your network takes time. Suppliers, customers, consultants, or brand ambassadors are all places to look. No matter the arrangement, perform on the deliverables, and pay it forward to other diverse small business owners when you can. The good news is that both mentorship and sponsorship arrangements can advance the diverse business owner community as whole. No matter which side of the relationship you fall on, these mutually beneficial opportunities can be the tide that rises all boats and can support lasting business growth.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/how-mentorship-and-sponsorship-can-help-business/"}

{"id": "8a4e828bb8ba-1", "text": "Tips for bringing someone on There\u2019s a lot that goes into the decision to hire \u2014 including money. The average cost per hire is nearly $4,700, per the Society for Human Resource Managers. To make that investment successful, it\u2019s important to consider the who, when, and how \u2014 as well as the role itself. 1. Determine the workload. Write down a list of tasks that aren\u2019t getting done that you expect a new hire to do. Examine if it\u2019s a cohesive role. Write a job description and start to think about the type of person who might be a good fit for it. 2. Set your budget. Think about what salary you can afford and then be sure to price in onboarding or training, employment insurance, and taxes like Social Security and Medicare. 3. Assess your options. Depending on the workload and your budget, explore the pros and cons of the different types of employees \u2014 salaried, hourly, temporary, intern, or contracted. 4. Cast a wide net. Post your job description and other details to job sites, message boards, and even social media. This can help you find candidates outside your immediate network, which is a good way to boost diversity and gain exposure to new people and ideas that can help your business.\n\nAction tip: Ask for references and follow through on any they offer. It can be easy to skip these steps as a small business owner, but due diligence at this stage can pay off down the road.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/how-to-build-and-manage-staff/"}
{"id": "8a4e828bb8ba-2", "text": "5. Provide measurable objectives. This helps you match candidate skills to the position. Plus, you establish clear expectations that can help you define success later on. 6. Test the waters. If you\u2019re not sure about the role you\u2019re looking to fill or the skill sets you need, start with a consultant or freelancer. Either hire the person on a per-project basis or invite a candidate to work with you for a day (paid, of course) to see whether they\u2019re a good fit.\n\nAction tip: Websites that pair companies and jobs with freelancers \u2014 such as Guru or Upwork \u2014 can help you find someone with the right experience levels and within your budget. Or consider outsourcing human resources tasks to a diversity-owned staffing firm from the most current list posted by SIA (Staffing Industry Analysts).\n\nTips for letting someone go 7. Weigh your opportunity costs. When you continue to invest in the wrong employee, you\u2019re missing out on a chance to hire the right employee who could help advance your business. 8. Analyze the fit. If an employee is a bad fit for a role, letting them go may mean they find a new job better suited to their skills. Of course, if they\u2019re a good fit for your company, consider if there may be tasks that need to be done, which might be a better fit. After all, they already know your business and brand. 9. Stick to facts. One benefit of clearly defining the jobs you hire for (tip five) is that it makes it easier to explain underperformance if it happens. If you\u2019ve discussed the issues and haven\u2019t seen improvement, it may be appropriate to part ways. 10. Ask for help.

As a business owner, you manage many assets on a daily basis, but you may be overlooking an important one: intellectual property. Your intellectual property includes the intangible assets you create for your business, such as names, designs, and automated processes. And just like tangible possessions \u2014 like supplies, equipment, buildings, and inventory \u2014 your intellectual property contributes to the value and success of your business. So it needs to be monitored and protected. Here\u2019s a breakdown of common types of intellectual property and tips on how you can protect these assets. Trademarks Trademarks are the words, phrases, and symbols that differentiate your brand from others in your industry. They must be distinctive and used in commerce to sell or promote a product or service in order to qualify as trademarks. Examples:\n\nCompany and product names\n\nSlogans and taglines\n\nLogos and symbols\n\nBrand colors", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/intellectual-property-what-it-is-how-to-protect-it/"}
{"id": "3f0bc3c698c6-1", "text": "Company and product names\n\nSlogans and taglines\n\nLogos and symbols\n\nBrand colors\n\nHow you can protect them: Trademarks may be registered with the federal government or your state government. Federally registered trademarks protect your rights throughout the U.S., while state-registered trademarks protect your rights only within the state\u2019s territory. While you\u2019re not required to register a trademark, having a registered trademark can make it easier to challenge anyone who infringes on your trademark rights. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) provides information on how to register your trademarks at the state or national level. Federal trademarks last as long as you use them with the public to promote your goods or services. Trademark applications generally cost between $250 and $350 per class of goods or services. To see if your desired trademark is available, you can begin searching the USPTO website or with a general internet search. A trademark lawyer can help you do a more detailed search to determine the availability of your desired trademark. Copyrights A copyright grants you legal rights to anything you create that expresses or embodies an idea. It gives you exclusive rights to copy, distribute, reproduce, display, and license the work. Examples:\n\nSoftware\n\nArchitectural designs\n\nGraphic arts\n\nVideo and sound recordings\n\nBooks and blog articles\n\nDatabases", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/intellectual-property-what-it-is-how-to-protect-it/"}
{"id": "3f0bc3c698c6-2", "text": "Architectural designs\n\nGraphic arts\n\nVideo and sound recordings\n\nBooks and blog articles\n\nDatabases\n\nHow you can protect them: Like trademarks, you have some rights to your original work without registering the copyright at the U.S. Copyright Office. However, registering can give you more leverage if you ever need to take an infringer to court. For instance, if an employee writes an article or takes a photo within the scope of their employment, the employer is the copyright owner automatically. However, an independent contractor who writes an article or takes a photo will be the copyright owner of that asset unless they transfer the copyright through a written contract. As with trademarks, registering them officially can give you more leverage in the event of a dispute. A copyright empowers you to profit from your creative assets. You can sell your copyrighted assets and lease them in exchange for license fees and royalties. A new copyright owned by an individual typically lasts 70 years after the death of the copyright owner. A copyright owned by a limited liability company (LLC) or other legal entity will last 95 years from the first date the work was used with the public. You can file to register a copyright with the United States Copyright Office. The current online application fee for basic registrations is $45 to $65. Patents Patents are granted for new, useful inventions, and they will give you the right to prevent others from making, using, or selling your invention. Examples:\n\nUtility patents: for tangible inventions, such as products, machines, devices, and composite materials, as well as new and useful processes Design patents: the ornamental designs on manufactured products Plant patents: new varieties of plants", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/intellectual-property-what-it-is-how-to-protect-it/"}
{"id": "3f0bc3c698c6-3", "text": "How you can protect them: Patent applications can be filed in the United States with the USPTO, and internationally in the patent office of the applicable country or region. U.S. utility and plant patents have a term of 20 years, while design patents have a term of 15 years. Patents require a nonrefundable filing fee, along with issue, service, and maintenance fees. This can add up to thousands of dollars, but some small businesses qualify for discounts. Before submitting your patent application, you can (but are not required to) search existing patents and published patent applications to see if your concept has comparatively novel features. A patent lawyer can help you do a more thorough search to determine the availability of patent protection for your concept. They can also help you investigate whether any third parties have patents that could prevent you from bringing your product or service to market. Trade secrets A trade secret is a piece of confidential business information whose secrecy gives you an advantage over your competitors.

Some examples of ways to protect trade secrets include internal policies that restrict access to the trade secret, employment agreements, and non-disclosure agreements. You can take legal action against those who misappropriate your trade secrets. Get started: Put protections in your business plan Intellectual property rights can help you establish your brand identity, profit off your unique assets, and prevent others from using your creations. Making them part of your business plan can help ensure nothing\u2019s missed. Start by listing all your intellectual property assets, then consider which assets need to be protected. Budget for the time and money you\u2019ll need to properly secure the rights to your creations, and outline how you plan to protect your intellectual assets. Finally, set deadlines for research, filing, and finalizing these steps and work toward them as you would any other business goal.

The COVID-19 crisis forced many small business owners to make tough decisions about whether they want to continue investing in their current business or prioritize other goals, like retiring, buying a home, or paying for a child\u2019s education. If you have assessed your situation and decided now may be the time to exit, it\u2019s important to consider the many options available, from selling part or all of your business to winding it down completely. Use these questions to help you determine your next steps. Once you\u2019ve determined them, fill out our worksheet (PDF), which includes details and definitions, to help you get started. How much is your business worth? You may have a rough idea of what your business is worth based on your current revenue, profitability, or balance sheet. But if you\u2019re thinking of potential exit strategies, a ballpark figure isn\u2019t enough. You need to have a clear, detailed understanding of what your business is worth before you can decide how to move forward. There are a number of ways to value a business, which is important to consider if your sales have fluctuated a lot due to the pandemic.\n\nThe asset approach to valuation tallies all tangible assets the business owns and subtracts liabilities. The market approach considers the market value of other companies in the same industry to arrive at a figure for your own business. The income approach is calculated using net cash flow, or profitability.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/is-an-exit-strategy-your-best-move/"}
{"id": "897d16b6a2f3-1", "text": "Action tip: Consider using a professional appraiser. Business appraisals are similar to home appraisals: both provide an unbiased assessment of value. Does a sale make sense? A sale may be the best way to cash in on the value in your business. But a sale doesn\u2019t make sense for everyone. To help you determine if you\u2019re ready to sell, and which type of sale might make sense, start by thinking about whether you\u2019re comfortable relinquishing control of the business and, if so, how much. Remember, there are many ways to structure a sale; it\u2019s not just selling and walking away. We recommend cutting this because we\u2019re not sure how long interest rates will beat record lows.\n\nAn outright sale is the traditional idea of a \u201csale,\u201d where you transfer ownership immediately and receive payment immediately. A partial sale involves selling a stake of your business to raise capital. This can be done so you retain majority control of your business. In a gradual sale, you offer a long-term payment plan for buyers who can\u2019t afford immediate payment. In a revenue or profit share, you may receive an upfront payment similar to in an outright sale, but the agreement also includes terms that allow you a share of revenue or profits going forward.\n\nIt\u2019s important that you look for buyers who agree to your terms and vision, as there\u2019s often an intangible and emotional component to selling a business.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/is-an-exit-strategy-your-best-move/"}
{"id": "897d16b6a2f3-2", "text": "Action tip: Strategically, you may want to consider selling to a competitor. However, this can be a more complex process. If you go this route, be confident in your valuation, divulge information gradually, and be ready to walk away if they refuse to budge on terms that are important to you. Working with a team of professionals \u2014 like bankers, lawyers, or even a business broker \u2014 can help you protect your interests. Does liquidation make sense? It almost always makes sense to explore a sale first, since businesses tend to have the most value when they are operating (because of the value of your client list and other intangible assets). But in some cases, particularly if you\u2019ve been shut down or operating at partial capacity, or if you have a wealth of inventory and/or machinery, liquidation may make sense. If you choose this path, consider the different types of sales for your assets: Consignment, internet or sealed bid auctions, and retail are the most common. Keep in mind that you may be charged fees if you use an intermediary to help you sell assets and that the liquidation value of assets is generally 20% less than retail value.\n\nAction tip: Experts recommend using a non-recourse bill of sale when liquidating assets. This means that the buyer accepts the risks associated with the goods they\u2019re buying. This will help you move on to new ventures with a clean slate. Are you ready for next steps? If you decide you\u2019re ready to move on, there are a number of logistical steps that you\u2019ll need to complete. You\u2019ll need to speak with vendors, lenders, and suppliers about payoff options and contract cancellations. (If you sell, these may be transfers instead of cancellations.) You\u2019ll also want to cancel or transfer all registrations, permits, and licenses associated with your business, once you\u2019re sure of your exit date.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/is-an-exit-strategy-your-best-move/"}

Here\u2019s how to know if one is right for you. Professional organizations have many potential benefits. Whether organized by industry, group, or region, they can help you connect with other business owners, access ongoing education or industry guidelines, find discounts, and tap into opportunities you might not have on your own. But not all professional organizations are created equal. They vary in structure, benefits, and fees, to name a few. Ask yourself these questions to assess whether joining a professional group makes sense \u2014 and which one is the best choice for you. 1. What type of organization should you join? Think about the challenges facing your small business and then research what networks exist that might help address them. Namely, consider which type of group \u2014 industry, affinity, or regional \u2014 makes the most sense based on the challenges you\u2019re facing. For example, an industry organization may be a good choice if you\u2019re looking for new suppliers. Plus, you might find better prices, new customers, and ongoing education to boot. Industry groups can also help boost your credibility by offering access to certifications and training. For example, patients might feel more comfortable with an optometrist who\u2019s part of a professional association. If you\u2019re looking for broad support for either your business or life, an affinity group may be a better choice. For instance, female entrepreneurs looking for ideas to help grow a business while raising a family might join a group for entrepreneur moms. Finally, regional organizations \u2014 say, a local chamber of commerce or a neighborhood association \u2014 can help you stay on top of local rules and connect with your community.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/joining-a-professional-group-to-boost-business/"}
{"id": "dc7ac8ff29de-1", "text": "If you\u2019re working through multiple challenges as a business owner, consider groups within groups. For instance, your state optometry board may have an organization of female optometrists within it. 2. What professional organizations fit your criteria? Once you\u2019ve narrowed down your criteria, spend time learning more about the group, the benefits, and the requirements. Look up who founded it, how it\u2019s funded, and prominent members. Consider asking current members how they use the group and what they get out of it. If you\u2019ve decided that you\u2019d benefit the most from an affinity group and aren\u2019t concerned about location, you have a great base to start your research. For instance, a female entrepreneur might consider the National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO). If you\u2019re a female entrepreneur in manufacturing, you might look for subgroups within NAWBO. Or you could look up manufacturing groups in your area, then look to see if there\u2019s a women-only subgroup.\n\nIf you\u2019re having a hard time finding groups, consider looking at aggregated lists, like this list from SCORE targeted at women. You can also look to your existing network for tips or connect with business owners facing similar challenges. Or consider starting your own group. 3. How much does it cost? Professional organizations often charge a membership fee ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars per year. Whether these dues are worth it for you financially may be a big part of your decision to join. To answer that question, start with the money itself. What discounts will you be able to access as a member? Are there perks (like free subscriptions) that can help reduce other costs? Next, think about some of the \u201csoft\u201d opportunities you might be able to access. These are things that are harder to quantify but will ultimately boost your bottom line: access to potential new clients, webinars and ongoing education, or enhanced publicity, for example.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/joining-a-professional-group-to-boost-business/"}
{"id": "dc7ac8ff29de-2", "text": "If the numbers aren\u2019t adding up, explore whether a partial, trial, or discounted membership is available. 4. What will I need to contribute as a member and what will I get out of it? Consider the norms, requirements, and standards of the group when joining. You might be required to join a certain number of events each year to stay a member in good standing. Even if there are no minimum requirements, many professional organizations (and many networking experts) advise giving more than you take as the best approach. Do you have time, advice, or other resources to share? If the answer is no, you might risk disappointing your new network, which might harm your business, rather than help.\n\nCarve out a block of time to check in with the network. Doing this even once a quarter can help remind you why you joined the organization and ensure you take advantage of its benefits. Professional groups and networks can be a great way to grow your business and connect to other small business owners. Joining, and staying involved afterward, is a good idea as long as the group is helping you achieve your goals. The best groups are those with active, involved members who want to be there and see a clear benefit. And remember, you can always choose to leave or switch to a new group if your needs change over time.\n\nArticle\n\nYou might also like\n\nThe benefits of women\n\n\n\nand minority\n\n\n\nowned certification\n\nGetting certified can help you discover opportunities and generate business.\n\nWe\u2019re here to help\n\nProducts & services tailored to your business needs Get started\n\nTalk with a banker\n\nMake an appointment\n\nAdditional resources\n\nMilestone Mapping Coaching Circles Get hands-on help setting and reaching business goals from a network of peer-mentors and industry experts.\n\nSmall Business Resources How to start, manage, and grow your business.\n\nAdditional Resources", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/joining-a-professional-group-to-boost-business/"}

Many women struggle to balance being a strong leader with being \u201clikeable\u201d or \u201cfeminine.\u201d But digging into the research on how men and women lead differently, and which leadership styles yield results, could help empower women leaders. That\u2019s because a growing body of research shows women possess unique qualities that make them highly effective leaders. Men and women tend to lead differently Across businesses of all sizes, men and women tend to have inherently different leadership styles. Women tend to be transformational leaders: they emphasize collaboration, morale, and motivation, as well as performance and communication. Transformational leaders define success more broadly than just meeting goals; they want their team to become better people. Men, on the other hand, tend to be transactional leaders: they are goal-oriented and want their team to meet expectations and be accountable. There may be less emphasis on the process for achieving these goals.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/leadership-styles-why-being-a-woman-may-be-an-asset/"}
{"id": "e493637e5087-1", "text": "Not all women are transformational leaders, and not all men are transactional. Think about the type of leadership style you identify with. This can help you identify strengths and weaknesses as a leader. The rise of transformational leadership Transactional leadership has long been the norm, particularly when it comes to running a business, where output and efficiency are key. Women who are transformational leaders might struggle in this context, and many women report feeling pressure to change how they lead. But this may not be the best solution, as more people recognize the value of transformational leaders of every gender (noteworthy transformational leaders include Oprah, Nelson Mandela, and Virgin CEO Richard Branson). While transactional leaders focus on output by setting goals, transformational leaders might notice that increased morale improves output. And that can be a very effective approach: A report from December 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, showed women are better leaders in a crisis, likely because their employees are more engaged. This heightened engagement is more common with transformational leaders. Recently, Harvard Business Review reviewed the research on the different ways men and women approach leadership. The result: They suggested male leaders emulate women \u2014 not the other way around. The importance of soft skills Transformational leaders need to be good at more than just business. They must also possess soft skills, or habits based in emotional intelligence (EQ). These skills \u2014 which refer to how you work and interact with people \u2014 can be vital to running a business. And they may come easier to women. A recent study looked at 12 soft skills proven to impact business performance, including empathy, self-awareness, mentorship, adaptability, conflict management, inspiration, and teamwork. Women outscored men in 11 of the 12. Embracing soft skills, rather than suppressing them, can help entrepreneurs navigate big decisions, high-pressure situations, conflict resolution, and constructive criticism.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/leadership-styles-why-being-a-woman-may-be-an-asset/"}
{"id": "e493637e5087-2", "text": "List times that soft leadership skills came in handy while running your businesses. Then, consider whether actively cultivating these soft skills could give you an advantage going forward. Of course, there are times when hard skills \u2014 talents and abilities that can be measured \u2014 are more important. And when it comes to running a business, hard results, like profitability or sales, are just as important (if not more important) than the morale of a team. However, it\u2019s important to remember that these ideas aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. Good leaders can possess both soft and hard skills: Transformational leaders can still focus on the bottom line, and transactional leaders can work on soft skills to help motivate their team. Personal leadership style In the same way skill sets aren\u2019t mutually exclusive, being an effective leader isn\u2019t about having one \u201cright\u201d leadership style. Good leaders often adapt their approach based on the situation at hand and the team they\u2019re working with. Studies show that women may have an easier time with this kind of adaptability. To figure out whether you need to adapt your leadership style, start by identifying your strengths and weaknesses. Then, create a list of leadership tactics that work best with your team and business model. Note where your strengths and weaknesses intersect with effective leadership tactics. This exercise can help you develop a signature approach to leadership.

Take time to identify how and when you are most effective, then cultivate your own leadership style based on those traits.

Depending on the type of business you do, you may have begun to update your payment systems to account for this preference. Wherever you are in the process, though, there may be an opportunity to do more. Contactless payments are still gaining in popularity, and soon customers may be expecting a variety of contactless options everywhere they go. Look for your type of business below and see what might be a good move for you.\n\nFor traditionally cash-only businesses Consider a food truck, small convenience store, or barber shop \u2014 small businesses that may deal primarily in cash. Customers began carrying less cash during COVID-19; they wanted to pay in a safer way using contactless payments. Now many people are out of the habit of carrying cash or they may not have as much cash on hand as they once did. Business owners can adapt to this shift by making an effort to accept digital payments as well as debit and credit cards. Digital payment options include platforms that allow customers to pay you directly, from their bank account to yours. One example is Zelle\u00ae, which allows you to receive payments typically within minutes,1 using your business (or personal) email address or U.S. mobile number. You can also consider accepting debit and credit cards, either in plastic form or from a customer\u2019s digital wallet via a platform like Apple Pay2, Google Pay3, or Samsung Pay4. If fees were an impediment in the past, keep in mind that accepting cards may expand your customer base, which can help offset those fees.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/make-the-shift-to-contactless-payments/"}
{"id": "fbaf25674dba-1", "text": "Action tip: Research digital payment options as well as point-of-sale (POS) payment systems that can help you move away from cash and toward contactless payments.\n\nFor businesses that accept cards in person The COVID-19 crisis prompted some businesses to think beyond accepting debit and credit cards in store. Some businesses are allowing customers to pay by phone, while some are setting up e-commerce, so customers can buy online, then get their goods via in-store pickup, at curbside, or from a shipping or delivery service. While accepting card payments by phone or online may carry different fees than using a point-of-sale device, allowing customers to shop and pay however they\u2019re most comfortable may help boost business.\n\nAction tip: If you don\u2019t have a website, investigate how you can still take card payments online or by phone using web-based solutions. You can also create a website and add an e-commerce feature.\n\nBusinesses with brick-and-mortar locations might also go contactless in-store by using a POS system with near-field communication (NFC) technology. This means devices can communicate from a few inches apart so customers can place their smartphone, credit or debit card near your POS device to complete a transaction. There\u2019s no contact required, and the process is encrypted for security. Your POS equipment may already have contactless technology that you\u2019re not using. Look for the Contactless Symbol\u00a0 to check. If you don\u2019t see the symbol, you may need to upgrade your device. Doing so won\u2019t limit your customers to only use tap-and-go; they can still insert or swipe their cards.\n\nAction tip: Look for POS systems that enable contactless payments in addition to swipe and dip, since tap-and-go may help your business in this environment. You can generally use these same systems to accept online payments, too.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/make-the-shift-to-contactless-payments/"}
{"id": "fbaf25674dba-2", "text": "For service-based businesses that use billing Consider a law firm, accounting firm, or any business that invoices its clients. Going digital can help these firms move away from asking customers to mail checks to pay bills, which can help businesses better manage their money. One lawyer based in upstate New York told the ABA Journal that she added contact-free digital payment during the pandemic so clients could pay by credit card as well as checks. She did this in the hopes that giving clients new payment options might make it easier for them to pay on time. Plus, online payments generally sync with your accounting software automatically so you can send e-invoices and streamline accounts receivable.\n\nAction tip: Research online payments\u00a0or you can talk to your banker about options. Some systems may require specialized software.\n\nFor businesses that use billing and accept cards in person Many healthcare practices, professional services firms, and other companies that primarily accept payments from other businesses need ways to accept payments in person, using POS systems. But they may also need to be set up for billing or invoicing patients, clients, and customers. To reduce in-person contact, these businesses have a few options. One option is to switch to a contactless POS system to help minimize contact at checkout. Another would be offering clients the option of paying online or by phone. Or you might want to invoice for everything, billing clients for transactions that you normally do in person. (If you need help updating your billing software to be more efficient, and to reduce contact even further, see For service-based businesses that use billing.)\n\nAction tip: Upgrade your billing system to accept online payments and add a contact-free payment option to your physical location.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/make-the-shift-to-contactless-payments/"}

There are many types of microloans, but we\u2019ll focus on those funded by the Small Business Administration (SBA) in this article, as they tend to offer more favorable terms and more protections for borrowers. Keep in mind, the SBA offers \u201ctraditional\u201d loans, as far as size and terms, via lenders like Wells Fargo.

Microlenders typically offer more flexible terms. For example, a microlender may be able to finance your business based on a business plan and your projections for cash flow. They often require some form of collateral, however, as well as the personal guarantee of the business owner. Each microlender is looking for someone with a good business idea who, for some reason or another, can\u2019t get access to capital. While microloans may be just right for some businesses, they are typically best for borrowers with limited working capital and little to no credit history. Many times they are offered specifically to borrowers in underdeveloped communities and countries or prioritized for minority business owners, female business owners, and low-income applicants. In determining whether to lend, the most important criteria a microlender will look for are a strong business vision, an understanding of the marketplace and the competitive landscape, and", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/microloans-what-you-need-to-know/"}

Since many microlenders also offer support for business owners, not knowing these things may not be a deal breaker. The microlender may also be able to help you develop business plans, understand how much you need to borrow, and even walk you through the application. What can microloans be used for? Depending on how a microlender is financed, a microloan can be used for working capital, inventory or supplies, furniture or fixtures, machinery or equipment, or real estate. They cannot be used to refinance existing debt. How to find and apply for a microloan First, find an organization. The SBA provides a tool that can help you search for microlenders in your area. (Wells Fargo supports many of these microlending organizations.) Once you find an organization that fits your needs, find out what it requires to apply for a microloan.

Many small businesses go without employing treasury management solutions. Sometimes this is because they\u2019re not familiar with them, and other times it\u2019s because they feel they\u2019re doing fine without them. Simply put, treasury management solutions help a business manage their payables (money going out) and receivables (money coming in). In reality, even small businesses can benefit from convenient options for managing these aspects of cash flow. Why? The more time a business leader spends on administrative tasks like bills, payroll, and receivables, the less time they have to invest in strategic activities like sales growth and marketing improvements.\n\nAn overview of top treasury management solutions When it comes to day-to-day cash flow management, accounting software isn\u2019t the only resource to consider. For instance, if your business receives checks from customers, vendors, and suppliers, how much time do you spend taking trips to the bank to make those deposits? Consider switching to electronic deposits wherever possible to potentially improve cash flow management, keep your deposits safer, and save you some time. You\u2019ll also be notified more quickly if any deposited items are not good. Faster notification of returned items can help your business improve information collection and cash flow predictability. Specifically, here are some ways treasury management can help smaller businesses:\n\nAccept deposits and credit card payments. Make payroll, vendor, and tax payments. Paint a correct, current, and comprehensive portrait of their financial health. Send domestic, international, and foreign exchange (FX) wires.

The pandemic affected supply chains in unanticipated ways, and because the world is recovering at a varied pace, interruptions may continue well into the future. Manufacturers, distributors, and retailers may all be affected \u2014 as well as the businesses that serve them. Whether you\u2019re directly or indirectly impacted, this article can help you better understand why the disruptions are occurring and how to best prepare. Why the disruption? For years, most business owners in the U.S. favored a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d inventory system, where businesses keep just enough supplies on hand to meet demand. The strategy frees up cash and avoids waste. But it means there isn\u2019t as much flexibility when habits or circumstances change. Consider the food supply chain. Pre-pandemic, a restaurant\u2019s food supplies may have arrived via shipyard and/or big rig, depending on where the ingredients originated.

{"id": "94db52bc5684-2", "text": "After COVID-19 hit, staff shortages sometimes meant that trucks and ships were stuck in a distribution center or in a port for days. Food supply companies had to adjust \u2014 sometimes from week to week \u2014 based on which route had the fewest problems. In some cases, they (or the restaurants they supply) wound up investing in additional cold storage (either on site or at another facility) so they could order in bulk (in case of a future delays). In other cases, manufacturing and production delays (as with computer chips for cars) and high demand for certain items (as with lumber for home building) led to disruptions in the supply chain that affected a variety of businesses (small and large). Because of the potential for disruption at any and every stage of a product\u2019s journey \u2014 from raw material to end consumer \u2014 it has become very difficult to predict problems and find alternate options.

For instance, a wholesale business that switched from a supplier in China to one in Mexico at the beginning of the pandemic may have had to switch suppliers again when Mexico experienced a surge in COVID-19 cases. That same business may have shifted suppliers several more times in the months since, and they may need to continue to do so indefinitely. If you purchase supplies from another person or company, you\u2019re likely at risk. The degree of risk can depend on the location of supplier, the relationship you have with them, and the type of supply you purchase. To help plan ahead, monitor things as best you can.

If your business has enough cash on hand, consider adding inventory for the short term to protect against potential disruptions. Plan ahead by asking suppliers if you can stock up. Ask about discounts for orders exceeding your typical buy. Can you replace the supply with an alternative? If yes, take into account differences in price and quality. Can you find a new supplier? If you can\u2019t adjust the type of supply you need, look into finding a different qualified supplier. The same questions around price and quality apply. How flexible is your pricing? If the cost of your supplies go up, can you pass the increase on to customers or will it eat into your margins? Remember that passing costs on to customers carries risk. Can you update your products? A change in materials or suppliers could present an opportunity. If you\u2019re a jewelry maker affected by higher silver prices, you might consider silver plating on some designs. Can you handle a delay? Some of your customers might be willing to accept a delay in exchange for the same product. Ask suppliers if you can get the same supplies at a later time. (You may be able to ask for a discount, too, in exchange for waiting.)\n\nNot every business will experience a supply chain disruption directly. However, understanding what\u2019s happening with supply chains and the cost of raw materials can help savvy business owners with forecasts and future planning. If you expect a disruption, think through which solutions make the most sense for your business.\n\nSources: Bloomberg, CNBC, FDA, Marketplace\n\nArticle\n\nYou might also like\n\n5 ways to improve your liquidity ratio\n\nLenders and investors often use this metric to assess a company's financial health.\n\nWe\u2019re here to help", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/protect-your-business-from-supply-chain-disruptions/"}

Women-led businesses are on the rise, and more specifically those led by women of color in the Black and Latinx communities. Between 2007 and 2018, women-owned businesses grew by 58 percent. During that time, Latina-owned businesses grew 172 percent and Black women-owned businesses grew 164 percent.1 Asian-American women-owned businesses grew faster than women-owned businesses overall.2 But this surge in entrepreneurship faced a hurdle in 2020: COVID-19 disproportionately affected minority-owned businesses. And for all of the gains, a 2021 report by the Department of Commerce highlighted that nearly 83 percent of female business owners are white.3 Add to that an overall lack of mentorship and business resources available to these communities, and it\u2019s clear why businesses led by female minorities face unique challenges. To help address those challenges, as well as potential issues finding funding, we\u2019ve compiled a list of resources to help Black, Asian-American, and Latina women business owners.\n\nThe Growth Initiative from the National Minority Supplier Development Council allows certified minority-owned business enterprises (MBEs) to access equity capital from institutional investors with the National Association of Investment Companies (NAIC), a network of diverse private-equity firms and hedge funds. Accion, a nonprofit lending network, helps underserved entrepreneurs including low-income entrepreneurs, women, and entrepreneurs of color. Opportunity Fund provides loans to low- and moderate-income businesses in the arts, and those promoting economic and social justice.

Learn about a 1031 exchange\n\nMarch 2023\n\nThis IRS tax rule can help owners save on capital gains taxes by reinvesting in their business. Selling a building, property, or other business-related real estate is a big step for any business owner. While tax implications of a large asset sale may seem overwhelming, understanding Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code can help you save money and build your business\u2013but only if you reinvest the proceeds appropriately. Learn more about how a 1031 exchange works, what properties qualify, and who can help you navigate the process.\n\nWhat is a 1031 exchange? A 1031 exchange is very straightforward. If a business owner has property they currently own, they can sell that property, and if they reinvest the proceeds into a replacement property, there\u2019s no immediate tax consequence to that particular transaction. They can defer any capital gains taxes associated with that sale. This formerly applied to other types of business assets, but changes to the tax code have limited its application to real estate assets. However, there are other limits regarding what types of real estate qualify and the required timeframe of the transaction.\n\nWhat types of properties qualify? To qualify as a 1031, both properties involved in the exchange must be \u201clike-kind,\u201d meaning they must be of the same nature, character, or class as defined by the IRS. A few key points to know:\n\nMost real estate properties are classified as like-kind. A property within the U.S. may only be exchanged with other real estate within the U.S. A property outside the U.S. may only be exchanged with other real estate outside the U.S.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/selling-real-estate-1031-exchange/"}
{"id": "bb88b6fe5823-1", "text": "How does the process get started? When you sell your existing investment property, you\u2019ll want to work with a qualified intermediary (QI). A QI may be a CPA with 1031 experience, a real estate attorney, or a bank, such as Wells Fargo. Typically, before the first asset is sold, its owner and the QI will enter into an exchange agreement in which the QI is designated to receive funds from the sale and will then hold and safeguard those funds throughout the transaction. A QI can also consult with the business owner on how to remain in compliance with the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nWhen must the transaction be completed? While the overall exchange process may differ for each transaction, there are specific deadlines that apply to any 1031 exchange. After the sale of a business asset, the business owner must identify all potential replacement assets within 45 days. They then have up to 180 days from the sale date of the original asset (or until the tax filing due date, whichever comes first) to complete the acquisition of the replacement asset or assets.\n\nWhere do I start? Seeking a QI is the first step in processing a successful 1031 exchange. Make sure you work with a high-quality intermediary, such as a bank. There is no regulation over QIs so using someone with experience and knowledge is important. Also, speak with a tax advisor who can help with guidance to your particular transaction.\n\nArticle\n\nYou might also like\n\nA business owner\u2019s guide to balance sheets\n\nPreparing balance sheets can help attract investors.\n\n5 ways to improve your liquidity ratio\n\nLenders and investors often use this metric to assess a company's financial health.\n\nWe\u2019re here to help\n\nProducts & services tailored to your business needs Get started\n\nTalk with a banker\n\nMake an appointment\n\nAdditional resources\n\nSolutions for Women Entrepreneurs Resources tailored to the needs of women-led businesses, designed to help you succeed.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/selling-real-estate-1031-exchange/"}

Here\u2019s what to know \u2014 and actions to consider taking today. Cybersecurity threats are more common than ever and a growing threat to small businesses. The shift to remote and hybrid work has provided more opportunities for security breaches \u2014 ranging from malware to stolen customer data \u2014 that businesses need to arm themselves against. Why should you be concerned? There was a 38% increase in cyberattacks worldwide in 2022, according to Check Point Research. Yet, only half of U.S. small businesses have a cybersecurity plan in place. The truth is many cybersecurity concerns can be addressed without incurring huge costs. Here are some key actions that small businesses owners in particular can consider that can make a dramatic difference in the fight against cyber threats. Keep your software up to date Out-of-date software can leave you susceptible to security breaches. To help protect yourself, ensure all devices on your network are running the latest software. Enable automatic updates and patches to your software to help protect against viruses, malware, and threats. On top of that:\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, install anti-virus, anti-spyware, and anti-malware programs for your computer systems, as well as a firewall. If you work with a technology vendor or service provider, see if they offer protective software for mobile phones or tablets. Secure your network with a firewall and use an encrypted, password-protected Virtual Private Network (VPN) to connect to the network. Avoid using unsecured public Wi-Fi networks like those found in airports, coffee shops, and convention centers.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/seven-cybersecurity-actions-you-can-take-today/"}
{"id": "7cc02df8dc12-1", "text": "Tip: Most mobile operating systems have a built-in VPN\u2014you just need to switch it on in your device\u2019s settings. Use strong, unique usernames and passwords When setting up a device, make sure all the default names, usernames, and passwords are unique, and don\u2019t reuse passwords across multiple sites. (\u201cAdmin\u201d is a standard username, and easy to guess.) Some suggestions:\n\nUse strong passwords or passphrases. Passwords should be a minimum of 12 characters (the longer the better) and use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Consider using a password manager app, which can help manage various unique passwords across different accounts. When possible, use multi-factor authentication. For example, two-factor authentication (2FA) may require a password as well as an access code sent to you via email or text.\n\nTip: Has it been more than 6 months since you\u2019ve changed your password? It takes just a few minutes and is a great way to help keep your account secure. If you think it has been compromised, change your password immediately. Manage devices and usage Define and create roles and needs for various devices so access is only granted as needed. This can help you track which hardware each employee can access and minimize access to sensitive information. On top of that:", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/seven-cybersecurity-actions-you-can-take-today/"}
{"id": "7cc02df8dc12-2", "text": "Outline your basic asset-management policies to understand what can connect to your network and who has access to what information. Access rules should be as specific as possible to limit those who have access to certain data, resources, and applications. Train employees to keep an eye out for issues like suspicious activity, bad connections, pop-ups, or phishing, as well as how they should report those issues when they arise. Educate employees about the proper procedure for device setup, and show them how to respond when prompted for device updates or if their device is lost or stolen. If you\u2019re thinking about a \u201cbring your own device\u201d (BYOD) policy, consider the impact of employees using personal devices to access sensitive work information, and set rules or limits accordingly.\n\nRemove employee or contractor access immediately after termination This is about more than controlling what a former worker can access. Unused but active login information can provide another possible access point for a security breach. To prevent this:\n\nMake it part of the offboarding process to dedicate time to change passwords and deactivate accounts for any terminated employees. Also conduct a thorough review of a former employee\u2019s computer or device to look for other profiles or accounts related to your business that may need to be changed or closed. Be sure to collect all company devices that the employee has in their possession at the time of termination.\n\nDon\u2019t forget about your smartphone More and more of us rely on our smartphones for most of our communications and day-to-day work needs. To keep all that information safe:\n\nEnable remote tracking and data wiping on your device, so if it\u2019s stolen, you can render your data irretrievable. Have a passcode, only download applications from trusted developers, install updates regularly, and don\u2019t open attachments or click on any links received in suspicious or unsolicited texts or emails.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/seven-cybersecurity-actions-you-can-take-today/"}
{"id": "7cc02df8dc12-3", "text": "Back up regularly Your data and information should be backed up regularly, not just as protection from cyber threats, but to keep your data intact in the event of a technology malfunction.\n\nIf you work with third-party technology and software vendors, talk to them about their policies for performing regular backups to make sure your information is secure.\n\nTip: Keep your backups disconnected from the internet so that hackers have no way to access them. Be proactive \u2014 and customize as you go Any cybersecurity plan begins with being proactive. The tips above can help you get started, but you should also put together a plan specific to your company, its needs, and all potential threats. When determining your cybersecurity needs, consider the types of breaches most common in your industry. For instance, if your business is cloud-based with numerous connected devices, you\u2019ll need a plan detailing how your employees access and treat secure information. Cybersecurity threats can be a risk to your business \u2014 and they\u2019re more common than ever. But arming yourself with knowledge and taking simple actions can help protect your business from security breaches.

For years, research has shown that female entrepreneurs are less likely than their male counterparts to seek financing from investors for their startup business. Instead, they\u2019re more likely to use credit cards and personal loans to finance their dream. But looking beyond your own bank account has its benefits, including ones you may not be aware of. Working with outside investors may allow you to access funds for expansion and improvements without taking on extra debt. What\u2019s more, investors often provide business guidance and access to their network of professionals, which can give you a competitive edge. Here\u2019s a quick overview of two common sources of investor dollars \u2014 and the pros and cons of each \u2014 plus how to decide if you should make a pitch, and what to say if you do. A quick look at private equity and venture capital Private equity (PE), simply put, refers to capital \u2014 money or other assets \u2014 invested in a privately owned business. The word equity refers to the value of the \u201cshares\u201d issued by your business to those investors. There\u2019s also a specific type of PE that\u2019s gotten a lot of press lately called venture capital (VC). PE and VC investors are similar in that both groups receive a portion of your profits when you are doing well. But there are a few key differences.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/should-you-look-for-investors/"}
{"id": "4a464bbf8a7b-1", "text": "PE investors tend to fund more well-established businesses. They often expect the majority share of your company in exchange for their investment. VCs focus on startups and early-stage businesses. They tend to take a smaller share, which exposes them to greater risk. Why do they do it? Because they see the long-term potential in the business and believe their investment will grow over time.\n\nLook into pitching female investors or women-led equity firms. Just as female managers and mentors enjoy helping other women succeed within business organizations, financially powerful women often are keen to help other women or grow their own business. The pros and cons of seeking private investors Whether you work with a VC or a PE investor, you\u2019ll gain access to the capital you need. But it\u2019s important to remember that, in exchange, you\u2019ll likely be giving up some control and future profits. Here\u2019s a quick look at some pros and cons. Pros of seeking investors:\n\nYou\u2019ll avoid loan repayment, including interest payments. You may gain access to new perspectives, knowledge, and networks. You\u2019ll share the risk if things don\u2019t turn out as planned.\n\nCons of seeking investors:\n\nYou\u2019ll be giving up a percentage of your business \u2014 sometimes a majority stake, in the case of PE. You may lose some level of control and oversight regarding what you do and how you do it. You\u2019ll likely be required to pay a portion of your profits to your investors in the form of dividends, though terms of the agreement can vary.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/should-you-look-for-investors/"}

If you don\u2019t want financial strings attached to the advice you seek, reach out first to alumni associations, organizations for female entrepreneurs, your local chamber of commerce, and groups within your industry or sector. Questions to consider before making a pitch While an influx of capital from an outside investor can be helpful, who you work with can make a big difference. Ideally, you\u2019ll want to make sure any potential financial partners align with your overall mission and vision \u2014 and that they can offer the specific type of additional help that you need right now. Below are four key questions to ask yourself as you seek and vet potential investors. Each question is designed to help you make a well-informed decision that aligns your business goals with your need for capital.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/should-you-look-for-investors/"}
{"id": "4a464bbf8a7b-3", "text": "What is your timeline? Do you have the time to seek and pitch potential investors? If not, you may need to turn to more traditional means like credit cards and loans for now. What are your goals for the coming weeks, months, and years? If you\u2019re not sure, you may need to revisit your business plan. What are your specific needs? Would you benefit from access to additional resources, such as new suppliers and vendors, business mentors, or other networking opportunities? Or are you just looking for monetary support? Think carefully about where you might want or need to grow, then look for investors who are willing and able to provide that help. What is your leadership style? Would you like to continue providing hands-on direction for your business? Are you open to new ideas and new partners chiming in on ways to change and grow? How would you feel if you were left out of key decisions regarding your business? You\u2019ll want to be clear about boundaries with potential investors. What are your personal goals? Do you still want to be part of this business in the next year, five years, 10 years, or until you retire? What do you want your legacy to be? For example, are you seeking to promote equality or diversity along with your product or service? Or are you hoping to grow a business that you can pass along to the next generation?\n\nAny outside investor will inevitably become, at least in a small way, a part of your business.

You\u2019ll have limited time to make a pitch, so edit what you\u2019ve got to say and start with the most important points. For example, unless your cause or your goals are relevant to your bottom line, you don\u2019t need to talk much about your backstory. But if you launched an eco-friendly cleaning service for preschools because your toddler is highly allergic to traditional products, that may be a key differentiator that can spark interest. Share lots of data. Clearly outline for investors your business\u2019 potential for growth, both now and in the future. Make sure to do some industry research and share any findings that support your point. Do some name dropping. Consider getting certified as a woman-owned business and joining professional organizations in your industry, all of which can help you meet important people. Also connect with former coworkers and alumni, as well as any experts and celebs you might know locally or nationwide. Let investors know about any endorsements you\u2019re able to get as a result. Be willing to pivot. Particularly if you\u2019re pitching to PE inventors, keep an open mind. These business experts may suggest different paths or products for your business, which can help you grow and expand. Ask for more than you think you need. Women tend to ask for $35,000 less on average than men do, according to Fundera.

Business owners want to know about opportunities that can help them succeed. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers several such opportunities through their loan programs. The range of SBA loan possibilities might seem confusing, especially if you\u2019ve never applied for an SBA loan before. Here, we\u2019ll explain how SBA loans differ from traditional business loans, demystify some of the most popular types of SBA loans, and explore what each type of loan is meant for. And yes, you can apply for an SBA loan even if you have other business loans and lines of credit.\n\nSBA loans vs. other business loans SBA loans are a lot like conventional business loans. You apply for both kinds through banks and other lending institutions, and you qualify by showing that your business is creditworthy. Also, just like conventional business loans, the funds can typically be used to build working capital, finance a project, purchase a building, etc. The difference here is in the details: Because SBA loans are backed by the government, they allow lenders to be more flexible about features like down payments, repayment terms, and collateral.\n\nTake the SBA\u2019s online quiz to make sure your business meets the requirements for receiving an SBA loan.\n\nMost popular SBA loans Most SBA-backed loans fall into three main categories: 7(a) loans, 504 loans, and microloans. Here\u2019s what to know about each. 7(a) loans: This is the SBA\u2019s most popular program.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-administration-loan-program-get-to-know-your-options/"}
{"id": "34e7a012edc0-1", "text": "What they\u2019re for: Can be used for most business needs, such as buying property or equipment. They can also be used to fund business start-up, working capital, and business acquisition \u2014 sometimes all in one loan. Terms and considerations:\n\nMost are 10 years. When loans are used to fund real estate construction or acquisition, terms can be up to 25 years. Because these loans are guaranteed by the government, they can offer more flexibility than a conventional bank loan. For example, SBA loans may have a lower down payment (10% is typically required) while conventional loans usually require substantial down payments.\n\nKeep in mind that the SBA Express program provides a streamlined approval process and an accelerated turnaround time for SBA review. 504 loans: These loans offer long-term, fixed-rate financing for major fixed assets that are likely to promote growth or lead to job creation.\n\nWhat they\u2019re for: Typically used for the purchase or construction of large buildings, the expansion of existing operations, or for big equipment or machinery purchases. The key piece is that the projects may have an impact on the local economy and may potentially create jobs.

{"id": "34e7a012edc0-2", "text": "Because the loans are backed by the SBA, 504 loans offer long terms (up to 25 years), low down payments, and fixed rates. The 504 loan program is managed by Certified Development Companies (CDCs), which are non-profit organizations regulated by the SBA that focus on community economic development. This program actually requires two loans: one from the CDC (which covers 40% of the total amount of the loan) and another loan from a financial institution (which covers an additional 50% of the total amount of the loan). Keep in mind that businesses will need to cover the remaining 10% of the total amount of the loan. Any business in almost any industry looking for funds to help with growth that could lead to economic development or job creation should contact a CDC about 504 loans. You can find a CDC near you through the SBA website.\n\nMicroloans: A microloan is a smaller loan meant to help businesses with start-up or other costs.\n\nWhat they\u2019re for: Typically used for the purchase of machinery, equipment, supplies, and other start-up costs. Microloans can\u2019t be used to purchase real estate or pay existing debt. Terms and considerations:\n\nMicroloans often offer lower interest rates than businesses are likely to get from online lenders, with better financing options and repayment terms of up to seven years. The average size of these loans is typically less than $50,000; the average microloan is $14,434.\n\nKnow what you want to accomplish.

Here are five key factors Diverse small business owners can be more reluctant to take on debt \u2014 whether it\u2019s due to a bad personal experience with borrowing or not wanting the burden of debt repayment. But before you write off using debt, consider its potential to help your small business grow. Debt can allow you to take advantage of a business strategy known as \u201cleverage.\u201d That means you use the loan to increase the return on the investment. Simply put, your debt may help you make more money. That may seem counterintuitive. After all, taking on debt comes with a cost \u2014 typically a monthly payment that will include interest and in some cases fees. While you might be reluctant to add another expense to your books, if you crunch the numbers, it might make more sense than you think \u2014 as long as there\u2019s a reasonable expectation you can get favorable loan terms and repay the money. Keep in mind that while a loan may not be a solution to create additional profit on a single project, it can be a powerful tool that allows a business to keep more cash on hand. And that cash can be put toward additional investments that could ultimately drive long-term growth and future profits. Let\u2019s compare two small businesses to see how a business can use leverage to potentially create more available cash to drive growth.\n\nHow debt can help a small business grow\n\nXYZ Business\n\nABC Business\n\nUses cash to buy $100,000 worth of inventory", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-debt-and-minority-owned-business/"}
{"id": "b5f921d81c1c-1", "text": "XYZ Business\n\nABC Business\n\nUses cash to buy $100,000 worth of inventory\n\nUses $50,000 of cash + a $50,000 installment loan to buy $100,000 worth of inventory\n\nResell at $160,000 for $60,000 in profit\n\nResell at $160,000 for $60,000 in profit\n\n$60,000 cash on hand to invest in growth\n\n$105,000* cash on hand to invest in growth\n\nThere is an interest repayment of $4,500 as well as the principal repayment of $50,000 on the loan.\n\nWhile both businesses turn the same initial profit on this project, it leaves ABC with much more cash to invest in future growth. That\u2019s because ABC only used $50,000 in cash to purchase the inventory, compared to XYZ\u2019s $100,000 in cash.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s obviously risk \u2014 because there\u2019s no guarantee ABC would resell the inventory immediately \u2014 this example shows how debt gives a business more opportunities to create growth by having more available cash.\n\n5 questions to ask yourself before taking on debt for your business While debt can be a tool to boost growth for many businesses, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best solution for everyone. Here are five essential questions to ask yourself to help determine if taking on debt is right for your business.\n\n1. What are my immediate and long-term business goals? You should know exactly how you will use your loan. Some possibilities might include:\n\nBuying inventory (immediate)\n\nSupporting operations (mid\n\n\n\nto long\n\n\n\nterm)\n\nPurchasing property (long\n\n\n\nterm)\n\nWithout a clear purpose for the money you\u2019ll borrow, you risk spending it in a way that won\u2019t support your business growth objectives. Whenever possible, tie your loan to an expense that has a specific, measurable revenue outcome.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-debt-and-minority-owned-business/"}
{"id": "b5f921d81c1c-2", "text": "2. What is my plan to repay debt? You should know exactly how you will use your loan. Some possibilities might include:\n\nSelling additional inventory and/or services\n\nLeasing out space to help service the debt\n\nReducing overhead costs to increase profit margins\n\n3. How will debt payments affect my present financial situation? This question will help you assess if your current revenue will support debt payments or cause undue strain on your cash flow, especially if the debt won\u2019t add to your business income immediately. Suppose you\u2019ve crunched the numbers and have found that adding a debt payment would cause financial strain. This just means you have to go back to the drawing board. For instance, you can find a way to accelerate or increase your revenues, consider borrowing less money, or pressing pause on your plan to borrow money until you can comfortably afford the repayment.\n\n4. What business risks do I face? Specifically, you want to identify any risk that could prevent you from repaying the loan, such as a sudden decline in revenue, increased operational costs, or staff shortages. To address these issues, you may consider adding more income streams to your business model, researching backup suppliers, or building redundancies into your staffing plans. Be as thorough as you can to address any risks that could prevent you from meeting your debt obligations. Defaulting on loans could prevent you from using debt as a tool to grow your business in the future, so it\u2019s worth assessing all of these details.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-debt-and-minority-owned-business/"}
{"id": "b5f921d81c1c-3", "text": "5. Do I have a backup plan? You\u2019ve asked the questions and crunched the numbers, but there\u2019s still a chance something beyond your control happens to your business. To be safe, you should have a plan to recover or continue operations \u2014 including covering your debt service. Your backup plans might include having additional cash reserves in the form of personal or business savings. You may also explore strategic partnerships or joint ventures to help you through setbacks. Many businesses also find success in modifying their business model or pivoting when faced with emergencies that could affect cash flow. After asking yourself these questions, if you still think taking on debt could help with business growth, talk to your banker about various lending products that could meet your needs. Even if you aren\u2019t ready to take on debt today, knowing your options can be helpful for future planning.\n\nArticle\n\nYou might also like\n\nYou\u2019re more than your numbers\n\nA compelling business loan application can strengthen your chance to take your business to the next level.\n\nHow minority business owners can make confident borrowing decisions\n\nLearn about what kind of risk you\u2019re taking on when you borrow.\n\nWe\u2019re here to help\n\nProducts & services tailored to your business needs Get started\n\nTalk with a banker\n\nMake an appointment\n\nAdditional resources\n\nWork with Wells Fargo as a supplier Learn about the broad range of opportunities we help provide diverse suppliers and how you can start working with us.\n\nSmall Business Resource Navigator Discover financing options and advisory resources in your area through our partnership with Community Reinvestment Fund USA.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nWork with Wells Fargo as a supplier Learn about the broad range of opportunities we help provide diverse suppliers and how you can start working with us.\n\nSmall Business Resource Navigator Discover financing options and advisory resources in your area through our partnership with Community Reinvestment Fund USA.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-debt-and-minority-owned-business/"}

Grants are funds awarded by government agencies, foundations, and corporations that you don\u2019t need to repay. As such, grants can be an important source of growth for small businesses. Additionally, there are a number of grants designed specifically to help certain types of businesses. These might be businesses in a specific industry, started by women, run by veterans, and so on. If you\u2019re interested in using a grant to help fund your business, consider these tips. 1. Know where to look There are a number of city and state governments that offer grants to small businesses. For example, Connecticut\u2019s Small Business Express Program offers grants to small businesses intended to stimulate job growth. The city of Chicago\u2019s Small Business Improvement Fund helps small businesses in certain neighborhoods with property improvements. Learn more about grants for diverse small business owners. The federal government\u2019s Economic Development Agency can help you find information about funding opportunities in your area. You can also research grants at the Small Business Administration website.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-owners-guide-to-grants/"}
{"id": "60e61f7f56da-1", "text": "Ask your network about grants they\u2019ve heard of in your industry or area, or whether they know of funds aimed at helping women. 2. Be prepared to apply Applying for a grant can be tedious \u2014 you\u2019re usually asked to supply a significant amount of information. But it\u2019s important to be thorough, since it can increase your chances of receiving the grant. You\u2019ll likely need to share details about your business, its finances, and how the grant will be used. The entire application process typically takes at least six weeks and may include several rounds of meetings and/or review. Even after that, you may wait another six to 12 months to get a response. If you don\u2019t receive a grant on your first application, be prepared to try again. Some companies submit dozens of applications before being chosen.\n\nDepending on your cash flow and the size of the grant in question, it may make sense to hire a professional grant writer to help with your proposal. If you don\u2019t have the funds to hire a professional, ask your network if they have any experience applying for grants; you could discover helpful advice. 3. Be both realistic and optimistic In exchange for not having to repay the money offered in a grant, they often come with terms and conditions for how the money is used. Government grants often have stricter requirements than those from private corporations (since they\u2019re funded by taxpayer dollars). The good news is, you may be able to apply for multiple grants to fulfill different needs within your business. Plus, some grants can be renewed if you\u2019re able to verify that you\u2019ve used the funds as prescribed.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-owners-guide-to-grants/"}

It can be even more difficult for diverse small business owners, who are more likely to already be in financial distress and who may face additional barriers in obtaining financing.1\n\nCash flow is the first priority When money gets tight, your first priority is to \u201ckeep the lights on\u201d and continue to pay yourself and your employees. To do that, you need to address your cash flow. Here are a few options:\n\nMake \u201cinvisible\u201d cutbacks. Look at your largest expenses first and see whether there are ways to save money that will not be noticed by customers. For example, you may be able to use utilities more efficiently or work out better deals with your suppliers. Your landlord might even be willing to renegotiate your lease if doing so prevents them from having to fill a vacancy in a difficult economy.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-preparation-for-economic-downturn/"}
{"id": "6173a8efe260-1", "text": "Research your financing options. You may hesitate to seek out a loan in a downturn because you\u2019re averse to taking on new debt or skeptical that you can find terms that will work for you. But rather than reject the idea out of hand, do some research. You may be surprised to find that there could be government loan programs or private lending options that suit you. Some opportunities are specifically aimed at diverse small business owners. For example, during the pandemic, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation\u2019s Coalition to Back Black Businesses began awarding $25,000 grants to Black-owned small businesses.2\n\nFind new revenue streams. Finding new revenue streams just as the economy stalls may sound a little like jumping out of a plane and knitting a parachute on the way down, but you may find opportunities if you look. Search for options that don\u2019t appreciably increase your operating costs. Is there an online marketplace you haven\u2019t joined yet? Can you adapt your consumer-facing services for business customers?\n\nOnce the economy has started moving again, you can prepare for the next downturn. Focus on building up your cash reserves and paying down debts to alleviate some of the pain if revenues decline. You can also appraise your assets and keep an eye on your business credit score. You\u2019ll have a clearer sense of your financial options, should you need financing to meet cash flow needs through a dry spell.\n\nKeep your customers and employees engaged Making ends meet is essential, but if you\u2019re really going to survive through an economic downturn, you also need to hold on to your customer base and keep your employees motivated. Here are some approaches to consider:", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-preparation-for-economic-downturn/"}
{"id": "6173a8efe260-2", "text": "Adjust your offerings. If your customers are feeling the pinch and can\u2019t spend like they used to, it may make sense to assess and adjust your products to meet your customers where they are. For instance, chocolatier Isabel Garcia Nevett responded to a looming downturn by adding coffee to the in-store menu to keep retail clients coming back to the shop.3\n\nReach out to your biggest spenders. If your business benefits from a small group of top customers, entice them to your business with special offers, cementing the relationship and boosting your cash flow at the same time.\n\nBoost employee morale with intangible perks. Keeping customer satisfaction high during a downturn means keeping your employees motivated, happy, and productive. Even if you\u2019re not in a position to invest more money in employee benefits, you may be able to offer intangible perks such as more flexibility to promote work-life balance, more autonomy in day-to-day work, or employee discounts that don\u2019t drastically affect your bottom line.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-preparation-for-economic-downturn/"}
{"id": "6173a8efe260-3", "text": "Address the short term, but keep an eye on the long term When a downturn hits, it can feel like your only goal is to get through the next several months. But even as you\u2019re focused on keeping all the plates spinning, you should keep the long-term health of your business in mind, especially when evaluating your financing options. Scrutinize potential loans to ensure that the terms of repayment work for you \u2014 today and tomorrow. Taking out an adjustable-rate loan, for example, may solve your immediate problems, but if interest rates are about to rise, it may not work for you in the long run. You should also be careful if you lower price points on your suite of goods and services. Try to offer slimmed-down options that meet the quality expectations customers have of your brand. At the same time, avoid lowering the sticker prices of your current offerings. It may be difficult to restore prices later. Ideally, the short-term moves you make in an economic downturn should position your business to keep growing when the economy has gotten back up to speed.\n\n1.

You\u2019ve worked hard to build your business and steer its growth. But while your leadership has been the key to your company\u2019s current success, its longer-term future depends on how well you prepare for when you\u2019re no longer at the helm. That preparation is your business succession plan. In many family businesses, knowledge about succession planning processes and strategies might be passed on from one generation to the next. But for diverse-owned businesses, that know-how isn\u2019t always easy to come by. Diverse small business owners, particularly those who are Black and Hispanic, are more likely to be first-generation entrepreneurs. Failure to create a succession plan creates risks. New leaders might be uncertain about their future with the company or aren\u2019t prepared for their roles. Lack of a plan also increases the likelihood your business won\u2019t survive your departure. On the other hand, a well-thought-out succession plan increases the chances of a smooth transition and the long-term continuation of your business. If you haven\u2019t yet tackled succession planning because you\u2019re new to the process, a few basic guidelines may help you get started. Here are some best practices for developing a strong succession plan to ensure that the business you founded will survive, succeed, and continue to build generational wealth.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/succession-planning-and-what-to-consider/"}
{"id": "2bd649fb72b5-1", "text": "What to consider in succession planning Here are a few questions to think about as you begin making your succession plans: How do you envision your business transferring to its next owner? Do you plan to pass it down to an heir? Will you hand it over to a family member, a business partner or a key employee when you retire? Or are you more likely to sell the business to an outsider when you\u2019re ready to exit? Who do you want to step into your role? If you have your eye on handpicking your successor, there are things you can do now to identify the right person. Most likely, you already have a few potential candidates in mind. Now\u2019s the time to observe how they handle their current responsibilities and determine whether they seem capable of growing into a bigger leadership role. For instance, how do they relate to other employees and customers? How well do they manage finances? How familiar are they with the overall operation of the business?

{"id": "2bd649fb72b5-2", "text": "business? Does your ideal successor want to run the business? Of course, it\u2019s also essential to gauge the interest of those you have in mind as successors. Maybe your top pick loves the idea of becoming the next CEO. Maybe they\u2019re a bit hesitant but simply need some encouragement to boost their confidence. Or maybe they have zero interest in taking over. If that\u2019s the case you should probably move on to consider other succession strategies, like selling the business outright. How will you help the next leader get ready? If you tap the next leader without taking steps to prepare them for the role, you\u2019re setting them up for failure. Start the training now by giving them more involvement in decision-making and providing them with opportunities to acquire or improve the skills they\u2019ll need to lead. Mentoring your successor-in-waiting and allowing them to shadow or rotate into various roles and responsibilities at the company \u2014 like accounting, payroll, marketing, supply chain management, and more \u2014 can ensure they gain the knowledge", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/succession-planning-and-what-to-consider/"}

If there are other employees whose roles will change when you transfer the business, you may need to provide them with additional training or experience, too. How will you ensure that the selection process is fair and that you choose the people best suited for their roles? The perception that your decision is based on anything other than talent and ability can cause conflict. Some may even accuse you of favoritism or nepotism. To prevent conflict, it\u2019s beneficial to be transparent about the process and the qualities you\u2019re looking for. How do you want the ownership of the business to transfer?

Communicating a well-developed plan to everyone involved gives your successors a chance to build the skills and confidence they\u2019ll need to take over the business. A good succession plan helps avoid family conflict by keeping everyone in the loop ahead of time about the successor you have in mind. This gives you an opportunity to explain your reasoning. If the person you\u2019d like to tap to take over is on board with the idea, you may even want them to help shape the plan. Of course, the plan should also include a list of alternates in case your first choice isn\u2019t interested now or decides to switch career paths later. As important as it is to have a formal succession plan in place and to share it with your family members, don\u2019t think of it as set in stone. You\u2019ll need to revisit the plan from time to time to see whether changing circumstances require adjustments to it. But knowing that your succession plan will be fluid is no reason to put off making one. The sooner you plan your business succession, the better the chances that the company you built will provide a legacy and economic prosperity for your family.\n\nLearn more: Here are a few additional resources to help you navigate the succession planning process: SCORE, The Small Business Owner\u2019s Guide to Succession Planning Indeed, The Small Business Owner\u2019s Guide to Succession Planning U.S. Small Business Administration and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Selling a Small Business and Succession Planning for a Small Business\n\nArticle\n\nYou might also like\n\nThe value of creating diverse partnerships\n\nImproving diversity, equity, and inclusion one business at a time.\n\nMentors and sponsorships for growth\n\nFinding a small business mentor or sponsorship can be the key to reaching new levels of success.\n\nWe\u2019re here to help", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/succession-planning-and-what-to-consider/"}

Here\u2019s how the right credit products can help level things out. Steady cash flow is vital to the financial well-being of a business. But with healthy cash flow being subject to numerous factors \u2014 both internal considerations like payment policies and external factors like seasonal fluctuations \u2014 reaching financial stability can be a complex equation. Even the type of business you run can affect cash flow struggles. For the most part, medical professionals and attorneys seem to have more stable cash flow. Manufacturing businesses, however, experience ebbs and flows on a pretty regular basis. Newer businesses, as well, tend to have more instability than established ones. Credit products can potentially smooth out cash flow needs over time. Depending on whether a business needs access to credit on a quarterly, monthly, or even weekly basis, the owner can leverage credit cards, lines of credit, and loans to help stabilize cash flow. Determining which product is right for you comes down to how quickly you plan to pay it back. Here is some basic information on each of these options.\n\nWhen to consider a line of credit If a business owner needs to buy additional inventory or cover short-term payroll needs, a line of credit will allow them to do so. A line of credit provides businesses the flexibility to use as much (or as little) financing as they need and to pay it off either immediately or over a period time \u2014 whichever makes the most sense for their situation.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/using-credit-to-stabilize-your-cash-flow/"}
{"id": "7c861f427825-1", "text": "When to consider a loan A loan is a longer commitment \u2014 usually between 12 months and five years. A loan typically offers a lower interest rate than a line of credit, and you have to pay a set amount each month. Many small businesses like to be able to budget for that expense each month.\n\nWhen to use a credit card It\u2019s best to reserve credit cards for purchases that are small enough for you to pay off the debt by the following month. It\u2019s not smart to use credit cards for large purchases due to the higher interest rates. You may be better off using a line of credit, or even a loan, for those large purchases.\n\nWhat else to know about cash flow As you continue to explore the various types of credit available to you, ask yourself questions like: Is now the right time? In the case that I face a negative cash flow, do I have a contingency plan that will allow me to make my payments on time? Peace of mind is everything.

The prospect of rising rates may seem daunting for small business owners but the reality may be less worrisome. Small businesses\u2019 exposure to rising rates may be direct (for example, if you have a loan with a variable rate) or indirect (if your business is affected by changing purchase patterns as consumers react to increased rates). First, we\u2019ll review the specific risks, then we\u2019ll provide some tips for how you can prepare. Understand the risks Direct risk: Variable rate debt Business owners with variable interest rates on loans or securities will be most affected by any rate increases. Variable interest rates, also known as floating or adjustable rates, fluctuate over time based on economic conditions. Rate hikes could increase your interest payments on any loans, lines of credit (LOCs), or credit cards with variable rates, and thus the total you owe on these debts. Indirect risk: Changing consumer spending In addition, higher interest rates generally mean consumers cut back on spending, opting to save their money to receive higher rates of return. This behavior typically contributes to lower demand for goods and services. According to a September 2022 survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. households plan to decrease spending over the next year. Assess your exposure Now is the time to determine which risk, if any, is most relevant to your business. Start by reviewing the fine print on your LOCs, business loans, and business credit cards to determine whether your rates are fixed or variable or ask your lenders directly via their customer service tools.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/what-rising-rates-really-mean-for-you/"}
{"id": "bf35c15eb9e9-2", "text": "Action tip: While you\u2019re at it, check the rates on your personal credit cards, too. Likewise, assess whether your business is likely to be affected by changing consumer spending trends. Prepare for rising rates Tackle outstanding debt with variable rates. Higher rates mean it will take longer to pay off debt. Pay off as much of your loans or LOCs as possible now, as rates are expected to continue to rise. If you can\u2019t pay off all debt, try to renegotiate the terms to lock in today\u2019s lower interest rates.\n\nAction tip: Consider shifting your business and personal credit card balances to cards or loans with lower rates. Shift cash-management strategies. If you have extra cash on hand, consider moving it into CDs, money market accounts, savings accounts or other instruments that are low risk and benefit from rising rates. These vehicles will accumulate more interest when rates rise. Assess your plans for financing growth. Higher rates make it more expensive to borrow. As a result, it may be harder to access financing to expand or cover unexpected expenses. Consider seeking fixed-rate loans, such as those backed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) or another lender, which will protect you from future interest rate increases. Plan ahead for changes in consumer spending. If your industry is likely to be affected by cutbacks in consumer spending, consider bumping up your marketing efforts, such as targeting your most loyal customers and offering special promotions, to draw traffic.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/what-rising-rates-really-mean-for-you/"}

And while higher rates mean it costs more to borrow money, you\u2019ll also receive higher payouts on interest-bearing assets.

Here are 3 common approaches to figuring out a more accurate number. While women are passionate about the businesses they launch and run, Forbes has reported that female entrepreneurs tend to be \u201cmore conservative\u201d than men when estimating the value of their business. The writers noted that this may be one reason female entrepreneurs are less likely to get as much financing as men: Lenders and investors look at business value before doling out support, so anyone who is undervaluing their company (even unwittingly) might be preventing their own growth. Understanding the worth of your business can also be important for women looking to protect their assets in a divorce, and it can even ensure you\u2019re not overpaying on business taxes. It can also allow you to sell your business more quickly if a great offer crosses your desk. Here\u2019s a look at three of the most common approaches to business valuation and what businesses they tend to work best for. While you may want to work with a professional appraiser to determine the best valuation method for your business, this article can help you gather key information before doing the math together. Asset-based approach Think of an asset-based approach as, \u201cYou\u2019re worth what you own.\u201d This method typically adds up everything of value within the business (assets) then subtracts whatever you owe (liabilities and debts). The resulting number is often referred to as \u201cowner\u2019s equity.\u201d The asset-based approach generally looks at two main types of assets:", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/whats-your-business-worth-3-ways-to-figure-it-out/"}
{"id": "27effc8b60ce-1", "text": "Tangible assets. These are assets you can physically touch, like inventory, equipment, and real estate. It also includes assets with dollar value, like cash and the monies due to you from existing sales. Intangible assets. These assets are not physical but still have value \u2014 often because they give the business an edge in the market. This includes patents, proprietary technology, and customer loyalty.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/whats-your-business-worth-3-ways-to-figure-it-out/"}
{"id": "27effc8b60ce-2", "text": "Once the value of those assets is determined, the calculations turn to the business\u2019s liabilities or debts. These may include mortgages, equipment loans, interest payments, wages, taxes, accounts payable, and other money owed to others. The total of the business liabilities is subtracted from the asset total. Who is it best for? Businesses that have sizeable physical assets, such as real estate investments, heavy equipment, and inventory. Limitations: This approach doesn\u2019t take into consideration the ups and downs of the market or \u201canticipated\u201d earnings and growth, which may be much higher than what your books show. Plus, the value of intangible assets can be difficult to estimate. Income-based approach This method is based on your history of spending and earnings, as well as your estimates of future payouts and income. In short, it looks at your business\u2019s likely future cash flow, minus your expected expenses. This type of calculation requires pulling out your old tax returns and doing some research on the current market and what experts expect to see", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/whats-your-business-worth-3-ways-to-figure-it-out/"}
{"id": "27effc8b60ce-3", "text": "on the current market and what experts expect to see in terms of growth. Usually, you\u2019ll want to look at your net earnings from each of the past 5 years and what you expect to spend in each of the next 5 years, based upon expenses such as real estate, equipment, technology, office needs, marketing, taxes, wages, and so on. You may also or instead do projections based on 1 year or 3 years. Keep in mind that a dollar today will likely be worth more than a dollar tomorrow, and costs typically go up, not down. Who is it best for? Service businesses, which may generate high earnings without requiring much of an outlay of cash. And businesses expecting rapid growth in the near future (based on consumer demand, for example). In fact, the resulting value may be higher than if using an asset-based or market-based approach. Limitations: This approach is highly dependent on forecasts, which are typically subjective.

{"id": "27effc8b60ce-5", "text": "If COVID-19, supply chain issues, or other factors have affected your business\u2019s recent income, discuss the details with your appraiser and/or note them in your valuation. Be prepared to explain what you\u2019re doing to improve matters in the months ahead. Market-based approach This approach compares your business to similar businesses by looking at their market value. It\u2019s similar to a realtor comparing a new listing to other houses in the same neighborhood in order to decide what to ask for their client\u2019s property. The difference in a business setting is that it may be more complicated to figure out what to include. Using the house example again, an expert would know whether your new fixtures and patio actually add to the value of your property. For example, this approach may consider your sales and market share combined with similar data of competitors. Depending on your business, it may also look at future projections \u2014 for example if you own a campground and do more business in summer than winter. Who is it best for? Small businesses that compete with bigger public firms, which provide sales data in their quarterly and annual reports. Market-based approaches can also be used as a double-check for the findings of an income-based valuation. Limitations: Since privately held companies aren\u2019t required to disclose their financial information in the same way as publicly traded companies, finding enough data to do a market-based valuation may be tough for some types of smaller businesses.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/whats-your-business-worth-3-ways-to-figure-it-out/"}

This can help boost the value they place on your business as a whole. Getting started: Find a professional appraiser While various \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d tools exist for calculating business value, working with an experienced appraiser (typically, for a fixed fee) boost accuracy and confidence in the results. How to find an appraiser? You can get recommendations or referrals from the Appraisers Association of America, local business organizations, your accountant, or another trusted financial advisor.

Every small business owner needs partnerships with reliable vendors and professionals who have specialized knowledge that the owner or employees don\u2019t have. These partners could include accountants, attorneys, marketing professionals, tech consultants, and management consultants, as well as suppliers. Cultivating these relationships not only benefits individual businesses, it also can enhance the economic development of the broader community. Like many diverse small business owners, you may have a strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion by supporting other diverse businesses and your community through partnerships. Yet identifying potential partners and nurturing those relationships can sometimes be a challenge. Here are some tips to help you create and benefit from the mutual support of diverse business partnerships.\n\nFinding diverse partners Putting together a team of diverse partners can be especially difficult when there is a low representation of diverse professionals. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,1 diverse representation in professions such as law, accounting, or fundraising is scarce. Take these steps to find connections:", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/why-commitment-to-diversity-benefits-small-business/"}
{"id": "fadbb7087561-1", "text": "Start your existing network \u2014 including other diverse business owners, professional colleagues, customers, friends, members of your faith community and other acquaintances \u2014 to look for possible partners among them. You can also ask for referrals. Try several tactics to expand your network. For instance, you can join area networking organizations that focus on diverse businesses, such as the local chapters of the U.S. Black Chambers, the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce. You\u2019re likely to meet other business owners in a wide range of fields through these groups. You might also reach out to more diverse, industry-specific professional organizations for accountants, attorneys, marketing specialists, or IT specialists. LinkedIn and directories of diverse businesses, which are available from a variety of business and government organizations, are also sources to find diverse partners. Group members in your local area might be potential partners or be able to refer you to others. Consider connecting with fellow participants in the Minority Business Enterprise certification process, such as through the National Minority Supplier Development Council. Some of these business owners could become potential partners or link you to other diverse business owners.\n\nNurturing partner relationships Once you\u2019ve found potential candidates for the support roles you need to fill, you may need time to build relationships before you decide to partner with them. To get started, learn what trade and professional business groups your partners or potential partners are in and join. Volunteer for committee posts, help with planning events, or sign up to be a speaker. You\u2019ll have a much better chance of working directly with partners or potential partners this way, which is a great way to deepen relationships.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/why-commitment-to-diversity-benefits-small-business/"}

You\u2019ll find opportunities to start conversations with speakers, trade show vendors, and fellow attendees that could turn into helpful long-term connections. Also get involved in community activities where other diverse business owners will have a presence. Working side by side on a common cause is another effective way to build relationships. Once established, be sure to nurture a partnership, perhaps by touring each other\u2019s businesses, vetting or suggesting potential vendors, or helping out with a pitch or presentation Building relationships and partnerships is ongoing work. Just as any relationship requires constant care and attention, the same goes for partnerships. By sharing your expertise, others may share theirs. Offer to help other business owners if you know of a person or resource they might need. Helping these partners is a great way to show you\u2019re committed not just to your own success, but theirs as well. And always look for ways to repay any help you receive. Reciprocity is always appreciated \u2014 and it builds stronger connections.\n\nResources that can help These organizations provide opportunities for identifying and networking with other diverse professional service providers and suppliers:\n\nU.S. Black Chambers United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce Also check your local chapter of the U.S Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Small Business Administration or your local government\u2019s economic development agency for potential lists of diverse businesses and opportunities to network with small business owners.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/why-commitment-to-diversity-benefits-small-business/"}

An online search should turn up several national groups, plus information about any chapters close to you. Members and resources of organizations like these can be valuable in building relationships with other diverse-owned businesses. As you grow your network, be prepared to pay back, as well as pay forward, the help you get.

Learning how to write a sound business plan is an essential first step toward creating a successful business. Simply put, a business plan explains exactly what your product or service is and why people want to purchase it, as well as how you will tackle any environmental and market risks. It can help you clarify what you want to achieve and plan exactly how you will reach those goals. This, in turn, can help you motivate your team, promote your business, and make key decisions. A strong business plan also serves as an important communication tool for potential investors and lenders. It will allow you to articulate your current financial status, any sources of revenue, and how you plan to meet revenue projections.

List your expectations for revenues as well as the cost of your goods, rent, fuel, utilities, salaries, and other expenses. The final step: Organize it logically There are many ways you can organize the information mentioned above so you can share it with potential investors and lenders, current and prospective team members and managers, and anyone else who needs to understand your vision. Do your research and find a business plan format that works for your business. There can be different types of plans for different types of readers, i.e. investors vs. employees, so you can modify your plan depending on your audience.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/writing-a-business-plan-your-step-by-step-guide/"}

Yet, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that many minority-owned businesses, especially those owned by solopreneurs, have little time to devote to these efforts. There\u2019s no rule that you have to make major updates and upgrades all at once, and there are more resources available than you might think. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s worth making online upgrades part of your business plan this year \u2014 and how to find help easing into it.\n\nGet excited If you\u2019ve made it this far, you may be wondering why you should bother building an online presence. It\u2019s simple: Customers and prospects today are increasingly searching for businesses online. More than half of consumers today (64%) have been using a mix of online and in-person shopping for the past 6 months, per the Bazaarvoice 2022 Shopper Experience Index. And that trend is likely to continue. PwC predicts that e-commerce is expected to make up 95% of sales by 2040. Also consider this: In recent years, nearly one-third of global consumers have begun prioritizing purchases from minority-owned businesses \u2014 especially younger generations that are also known for being digital-savvy.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/your-online-presence-is-more-important-than-ever/"}
{"id": "81fce6aafea2-1", "text": "Get verified You can start to build an online presence without investing time and money into building a website (though you may want to do that later). Many people use crowd-sourced reviews on various websites to find information about businesses, so these third-party platforms are a great way to start building a digital footprint for your company. You can register your business with review sites like Yelp and search engines like Google. (Creating a Google Business profile only takes a few minutes, though you\u2019ll be asked to verify by mail that you\u2019re the business owner. This helps protect your business but can take a few weeks.) These and other online shopping and review sites are also giving businesses a way to identify as minority-owned. For example, Google Merchant Center provides an option to identify your business as Black-owned, Latino-owned, veteran-owned, or women-owned. Google Digital Coaches also provide free training and coaching to help Black and Latinx small businesses create a thriving online presence. It may be worth your while to research what your favorite shopping sites are offering to help minority-owned businesses. Not only do consumers use these sites to discover companies, the sites themselves often provide metrics about how many people searched for your business and what percentage engaged to find out more.\n\nAction tip: Boost your relevance once you\u2019ve registered your business or created a profile by asking customers to post reviews. Monitor these comments since they can help you better understand your customers, and good feedback can convince prospects to pick you.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/your-online-presence-is-more-important-than-ever/"}

This is just one type of small business that shoppers are seeking on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Pinterest. Creating social media pages lets you share information without creating a full-fledged website. You can instantly communicate a product launch, for example. It also makes it easier to have two-way conversations with customers, which can be helpful if you\u2019re not sure what products or services to keep or phase out. A number of social media sites also have e-commerce options, so customers can make purchases from your business via the social platform.\n\nGet a website If you\u2019re seeing a lot of traction on social media, consider creating your own website. It\u2019s much easier today than it was even a decade ago.

Taxpayers may use the optional standard mileage rates to calculate the deductible costs of operating an automobile for business and certain other purposes.\n\nFor the final 6 months of 2022, the standard mileage rate for business travel will be 62.5 cents per mile, up 4 cents from the rate effective at the start of the year.

Generally, for income tax purposes, a single-member LLC is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner and reports its income and deductions on its owner's federal income tax return. For example, if the single-member LLC is not engaged in farming and the owner is an individual, they may use Schedule C.\n\nSole proprietor. A sole proprietor is someone who owns an unincorporated business by themselves.

People such as doctors, dentists, veterinarians, lawyers, accountants, contractors, subcontractors, public stenographers, or auctioneers who are in an independent trade, business, or profession in which they offer their services to the general public are generally independent contractors. However, whether they are independent contractors or employees depends on the facts in each case. The general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if the person paying for the work has the right to control or to direct only the result of the work and not how it will be done. The earnings of a person who is working as an independent contractor are subject to self-employment tax.

Also, you must consistently use an accounting method that clearly shows your income and expenses for the tax year.\n\nUseful Items You may want to see: Publication\n\n538 Accounting Periods and Methods See chapter 12 for information about getting publications and forms.\n\nAccounting Periods When preparing a statement of income and expenses (generally, your income tax return), you must use your books and records for a specific interval of time called an accounting period. The annual accounting period for your income tax return is called a tax year. You can use one of the following tax years.\n\nA calendar tax year. A fiscal tax year. Unless you have a required tax year, you adopt a tax year by filing your first income tax return using that tax year. A required tax year is a tax year required under the Internal Revenue Code or the Income Tax Regulations. Calendar tax year. A calendar tax year is 12 consecutive months beginning January 1 and ending December 31. You must adopt the calendar tax year if any of the following apply.\n\nYou do not keep books. You have no annual accounting period. Your present tax year does not qualify as a fiscal year. Your use of the calendar tax year is required under the Internal Revenue Code or the Income Tax Regulations. If you filed your first income tax return using the calendar tax year and you later begin business as a sole proprietor, you must continue to use the calendar tax year unless you get IRS approval to change it or are otherwise allowed to change it without IRS approval. For more information, see Change in tax year, later.\n\nIf you adopt the calendar tax year, you must maintain your books and records and report your income and expenses for the period from January 1 through December 31 of each year.", "url": "https://www.irs.gov/Publication-334-(2022)-Tax-Guide-for-Small-Business.html"}
{"id": "2bee3a8e1856-37", "text": "Fiscal tax year. A fiscal tax year is 12 consecutive months ending on the last day of any month except December. A 52-53-week tax year is a fiscal tax year that varies from 52 to 53 weeks but does not have to end on the last day of a month. If you adopt a fiscal tax year, you must maintain your books and records and report your income and expenses using the same tax year.\n\nFor more information on a fiscal tax year, including a 52-53-week tax year, see Pub. 538.\n\nChange in tax year. Generally, you must file Form 1128, Application To Adopt, Change, or Retain a Tax Year, to request IRS approval to change your tax year. See the Instructions for Form 1128 for exceptions. If you qualify for an automatic approval request, a user fee is not required. If you do not qualify for automatic approval, a ruling must be requested. See the Instructions for Form 1128 for information about user fees if you are requesting a ruling. Accounting Methods An accounting method is a set of rules used to determine when and how income and expenses are reported. Your accounting method includes not only the overall method of accounting you use, but also the accounting treatment you use for any material item.\n\nYou choose an accounting method for your business when you file your first income tax return that includes a Schedule C for the business. After that, if you want to change your accounting method, you must generally get IRS approval. See Change in Accounting Method, later.\n\nKinds of methods. Generally, you can use any of the following accounting methods. Cash method. An accrual method. Special methods of accounting for certain items of income and expenses. Combination method using elements of two or more of the above. You must use the same accounting method to figure your taxable income and to keep your books. Also, you must use an accounting method that clearly shows your income.", "url": "https://www.irs.gov/Publication-334-(2022)-Tax-Guide-for-Small-Business.html"}

They are separate and distinct only if you maintain complete and separate books and records for each business. Cash Method Most individuals and many sole proprietors with no inventory use the cash method because they find it easier to keep cash method records. However, if an inventory is necessary to account for your income, you must generally use an accrual method of accounting for sales and purchases, unless you are a small business taxpayer (defined later in this chapter). For more information, see Inventories, later.\n\nIncome Under the cash method, include in your gross income all items of income you actually or constructively receive during your tax year.

You have constructive receipt of income when an amount is credited to your account or made available to you without restriction. You do not need to have possession of it.

If the amount you repay is over $3,000, a special rule applies. For details about the special rule, see Repayments in chapter 11 of Pub. 535. Expenses Under the cash method, you generally deduct expenses in the tax year in which you actually pay them. This includes business expenses for which you contest liability.

Accrual Method Under an accrual method of accounting, you generally report income in the year earned and deduct or capitalize expenses in the year incurred. The purpose of an accrual method of accounting is to match income and expenses in the correct year.\n\nIncome\u2014General Rule Under an accrual method, you generally include an amount in your gross income for the tax year in which all events that fix your right to receive the income have occurred and you can determine the amount with reasonable accuracy.

Dispositions of Business Property Introduction If you dispose of business property, you may have a gain or loss that you report on your tax return. However, in some cases, you may have a gain that is not taxable or a loss that is not deductible. This chapter discusses whether you have a disposition, how to figure the gain or loss, and where to report the gain or loss.\n\nUseful Items You may want to see: Publication\n\n544 Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets Form (and Instructions)\n\n4797 Sales of Business Property Sch D (Form 1040) Capital Gains and Losses See chapter 12 for information about getting publications and forms.\n\nWhat Is a Disposition of Property?

You exchange property for other property. You receive money as a tenant for the cancellation of a lease. You receive money for granting the exclusive use of a copyright throughout its life in a particular medium. You transfer property to satisfy a debt. You abandon property. Your bank or other financial institution forecloses on your mortgage or repossesses your property. Your property is damaged, destroyed, or stolen, and you receive property or money in payment. Your property is condemned, or disposed of under the threat of condemnation, and you receive property or money in payment. You give property away. For details about damaged, destroyed, or stolen property, see Pub. 547, Casualties, Disasters, and Thefts. For details about other dispositions, see chapter 1 of Pub. 544. Nontaxable exchanges. Certain exchanges of property are not taxable. This means any gain from the exchange is not recognized and you cannot deduct any loss. Your gain or loss will not be recognized until you sell or otherwise dispose of the property you receive. Like-kind exchanges. A like-kind exchange is the exchange of property for other like-kind property. It is the most common type of nontaxable exchange. To be a like-kind exchange, the property traded and the property received must be both (i) real property, and (ii) business or investment property.

If you finance the buyer's purchase of your property, instead of having the buyer get a loan or mortgage from a third party, you probably have an installment sale. For more information about installment sales, see Pub. 537.\n\nSale of a business. The sale of a business is usually not a sale of one asset. Instead, all the assets of the business are sold. Generally, when this occurs, each asset is treated as being sold separately for determining the treatment of gain or loss. Both the buyer and seller involved in the sale of a business must report to the IRS the allocation of the sales price among the business assets. Use Form 8594, Asset Acquisition Statement Under Section 1060, to provide this information. The buyer and seller should each attach Form 8594 to their federal income tax return for the year in which the sale occurred.\n\nFor more information about the sale of a business, see chapter 2 of Pub. 544.\n\nHow Do I Figure a Gain or Loss?

Next, subtract the cost of goods sold (line 4) from net receipts (line 3). The result is the gross profit from your business.\n\nBusinesses that sell services. You do not have to figure the cost of goods sold if the sale of merchandise is not an income-producing factor for your business. Your gross profit is the same as your net receipts (gross receipts minus any refunds, rebates, or other allowances).

Check to make sure your records show the correct sales tax collected. If you collect state and local sales taxes imposed on you as the seller of goods or services from the buyer, you must include the amount collected in gross receipts.\n\nIf you are required to collect state and local taxes imposed on the buyer and turn them over to state or local governments, you generally do not include these amounts in income.\n\nInventory at beginning of year.

For details on how to adjust cost of goods sold, see Merchandise withdrawn from sale in chapter 6. Inventory at end of year. Check to make sure your procedures for taking inventory are adequate. These procedures should ensure all items have been included in inventory and proper pricing techniques have been used. Use inventory forms and adding machine tapes as the only evidence for your inventory. Inventory forms are available at office supply stores. These forms have columns for recording the description, quantity, unit price, and value of each inventory item. Each page has space to record who made the physical count, who priced the items, who made the extensions, and who proofread the calculations.

First, divide gross profit by net receipts. The resulting percentage measures the average spread between the merchandise cost of goods sold and the selling price.\n\nNext, compare this percentage to your markup policy. Little or no difference between these two percentages shows that your gross profit figure is accurate. A large difference between these percentages may show that you did not accurately figure sales, purchases, inventory, or other items of cost. You should determine the reason for the difference.\n\nExample. Joe Able operates a retail business. On the average, he marks up his merchandise so that he will realize a gross profit of 331/3% on its sales. The net receipts (gross receipts minus returns and allowances) shown on his income statement are $300,000. His cost of goods sold is $200,000. This results in a gross profit of $100,000 ($300,000 \u2212 $200,000). To test the accuracy of this year's results, Joe divides gross profit ($100,000) by net receipts ($300,000). The resulting 331/3% confirms his markup percentage of 331/3%. Additions to Gross Profit If your business has income from a source other than its regular business operations, enter the income on line 6 of Schedule C and add it to gross profit. The result is gross business income. Some examples include income from an interest-bearing checking account, income from scrap sales, income from certain fuel tax credits and refunds, and amounts recovered from bad debts.\n\n8.

If your expenses are more than your income, the difference is a net loss. You can usually deduct it from gross income on line 3 of Schedule 1 (Form 1040). But in some situations your loss is limited. This chapter briefly explains three of those situations. Other situations that may limit your loss are explained in the instructions for Schedule C, line G and line 32.\n\n.

To be deductible, a business expense must be both ordinary and necessary. An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in your industry. A necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for your trade or business. An expense does not have to be indispensable to be considered necessary.\n\nEven though an expense may be ordinary and necessary, you may not be allowed to deduct the expense in the year you paid or incurred it. In some cases, you may not be allowed to deduct the expense at all. Therefore, it is important to distinguish usual business expenses from expenses that include the following.", "url": "https://www.irs.gov/Publication-535-(2022)-Business-Expenses.html"}

Cost of Goods Sold If your business manufactures products or purchases them for resale, you must generally value inventory at the beginning and end of each tax year to determine your cost of goods sold. Some of your business expenses may be included in figuring cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold is deducted from your gross receipts to figure your gross profit for the year. If you include an expense in the cost of goods sold, you cannot deduct it again as a business expense.\n\nThe following are types of expenses that go into figuring cost of goods sold.\n\nThe cost of products or raw materials, including freight. Storage. Direct labor (including contributions to pension or annuity plans) for workers who produce the products. Factory overhead. Under the uniform capitalization rules, you must capitalize the direct costs and part of the indirect costs for certain production or resale activities. Indirect costs include rent, interest, taxes, storage, purchasing, processing, repackaging, handling, and administrative costs.\n\nThis rule does not apply to small business taxpayers. You qualify as a small business taxpayer if you (a) have average annual gross receipts of $27 million or less for the 3 prior tax years, and (b) are not a tax shelter (as defined in section 448(d)(3)). If your business has not been in existence for all of the 3-tax-year period used in figuring average gross receipts, base your average on the period it has existed, and if your business has a predecessor entity, include the gross receipts of the predecessor entity from the 3-tax-year period when figuring average gross receipts. If your business (or predecessor entity) had short tax years for any of the 3-tax-year period, annualize your business\u2019 gross receipts for the short tax years that are part of the 3-tax-year period.

These costs are a part of your investment in your business and are called \u201ccapital expenses.\u201d Capital expenses are considered assets in your business. In general, you capitalize three types of costs.\n\nBusiness startup costs (see Tip below). Business assets. Improvements. .

Although you generally cannot take a current deduction for a capital expense, you may be able to recover the amount you spend through depreciation, amortization, or depletion. These recovery methods allow you to deduct part of your cost each year. In this way, you are able to recover your capital expense. See Amortization (chapter 8) and Depletion (chapter 9) in this publication. A taxpayer can elect to deduct a portion of the costs of certain depreciable property as a section 179 deduction. A greater portion of these costs can be deducted if the property is qualified disaster assistance property. See Pub. 946 for details. Going Into Business The costs of getting started in business, before you actually begin business operations, are capital expenses.

However, you can choose to amortize certain costs for setting up your business. See Starting a Business in chapter 8 for more information on business startup costs.\n\nIf your attempt to go into business is unsuccessful. If you are an individual and your attempt to go into business is not successful, the expenses you had in trying to establish yourself in business fall into two categories. The costs you had before making a decision to acquire or begin a specific business. These costs are personal and nondeductible. They include any costs incurred during a general search for, or preliminary investigation of, a business or investment possibility. The costs you had in your attempt to acquire or begin a specific business. These costs are capital expenses and you can deduct them as a capital loss. If you are a corporation and your attempt to go into a new trade or business is not successful, you may be able to deduct all investigatory costs as a loss.\n\nThe costs of any assets acquired during your unsuccessful attempt to go into business are a part of your basis in the assets. You cannot take a deduction for these costs. You will recover the costs of these assets when you dispose of them.\n\nBusiness Assets There are many different kinds of business assets, for example, land, buildings, machinery, furniture, trucks, patents, and franchise rights. You must fully capitalize the cost of these assets, including freight and installation charges.\n\nCertain property you produce for use in your trade or business must be capitalized under the uniform capitalization rules.

You had an accounting procedure in place at the beginning of 2022 to expense the cost of tangible property if the property costs $2,000 or less. You treat each computer as an expense on your books and records for 2022 in accordance with this policy. If you elect the de minimis safe harbor in your tax returns for your 2022 tax year, you can deduct the cost of each $2,000 computer. Improvements Generally, you must capitalize the costs of making improvements to a business asset if the improvements result in a betterment to the unit of property, restore the unit of property, or adapt the unit of property to a new or different use.\n\nSome examples of improvements include rewiring or replumbing of a building, replacing an entire roof, increasing the production output of your equipment, putting an addition on your building, strengthening the foundation of a building so you can use it for a new purpose, or replacing a major component or substantial structural part of a machine.\n\nHowever, you may currently deduct the costs of repairs or maintenance that do not improve a unit of property. This generally includes the costs of routine repairs and maintenance to your property that result from your use of the property and that keep your property in an ordinary, efficient operating condition. For example, deductible repairs include costs such as painting exteriors or interiors of business buildings, repairing broken windowpanes, replacing worn-out minor parts, sealing cracks and leaks, and changing oil or other fluids to maintain business equipment.", "url": "https://www.irs.gov/Publication-535-(2022)-Business-Expenses.html"}

This rule applies even if this work, performed by itself, would otherwise be treated as currently deductible repair costs. Election to capitalize repair and maintenance costs. You can elect to capitalize and depreciate certain amounts paid for repair and maintenance of tangible property, even if they do not improve your property. To qualify for this election, you must treat these amounts as capital expenditures on your books and records used in figuring your income.

Heating equipment. The cost of changing from one heating system to another is a capital expense. Deduction for qualified business income. For tax years beginning after 2017, you may be entitled to take a deduction of up to 20% of your qualified business income from your qualified trade or business, plus 20% of the aggregate amount of qualified real estate investment trust (REIT) and qualified publicly traded partnership income.

You can deduct actual car expenses, which include depreciation (or lease payments), gas and oil, tires, repairs, tune-ups, insurance, and registration fees.

No one factor alone is decisive. Among the factors to consider are whether:\n\nYou carry on the activity in a businesslike manner, The time and effort you put into the activity indicate you intend to make it profitable, You depend on the income for your livelihood, Your losses are due to circumstances beyond your control (or are normal in the startup phase of your type of business), You change your methods of operation in an attempt to improve profitability, You (or your advisors) have the knowledge needed to carry on the activity as a successful business, You were successful in making a profit in similar activities in the past, The activity makes a profit in some years, and You can expect to make a future profit from the appreciation of the assets used in the activity. Presumption of profit. An activity is presumed carried on for profit if it produced a profit in at least 3 of the last 5 tax years, including the current year. Activities that consist primarily of breeding, training, showing, or racing horses are presumed carried on for profit if they produced a profit in at least 2 of the last 7 tax years, including the current year.

You can rely on this presumption unless the IRS later shows it to be invalid.\n\nUsing the presumption later. If you are starting an activity and do not have 3 (or 2) years showing a profit, you can elect to have the presumption made after you have the 5 (or 7) years of experience allowed by the test. You can elect to do this by filing Form 5213. Filing this form postpones any determination that your activity is not carried on for profit until 5 (or 7) years have passed since you started the activity.\n\nThe benefit gained by making this election is that the IRS will not immediately question whether your activity is engaged in for profit. Accordingly, it will not restrict your deductions. Rather, you will gain time to earn a profit in the required number of years. If you show 3 (or 2) years of profit at the end of this period, your deductions are not limited under these rules. If you do not have 3 (or 2) years of profit, the limit can be applied retroactively to any year with a loss in the 5-year (or 7-year) period.\n\nFiling Form 5213 automatically extends the period of limitations on any year in the 5-year (or 7-year) period to 2 years after the due date of the tax return for the last year of the period.

Gross income from the activity also includes capital gains and rents received for the use of property that is held in connection with the activity.\n\nYou can determine gross income from any not-for-profit activity by subtracting the cost of goods sold from your gross receipts.

Your employee is deemed to have included the value in their income if you report it on their Form W-2 in a timely manner.\n\nYou treat the deductible amount as received in exchange for the property, and you must recognize any gain or loss realized on the transfer, unless it is the company's stock transferred as payment for services. Your gain or loss is the difference between the FMV of the property and its adjusted basis on the date of transfer.\n\nThese rules also apply to property transferred to an independent contractor for services, generally reported on Form 1099-NEC.\n\nRestricted property. If the property you transfer for services is subject to restrictions that affect its value, you generally can't deduct it and don't report gain or loss until it is substantially vested in the recipient. However, if the recipient pays for the property, you must report any gain at the time of the transfer up to the amount paid. \u201cSubstantially vested\u201d means the property isn't subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. This means that the recipient isn't likely to have to give up their rights in the property in the future.\n\nReimbursements for Business Expenses You can generally deduct the amount you pay or reimburse employees for business expenses incurred for your business.

See Revenue Procedure 2001-28 for examples of limited-use property and property that isn\u2019t limited-use property. Leases over $250,000. Special rules are provided for certain leases of tangible property. The rules apply if the lease calls for total payments of more than $250,000 and any of the following apply. Rents increase during the lease. Rents decrease during the lease. Rents are deferred (rent is payable after the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the use occurs and the rent is allocated). Rents are prepaid (rent is payable before the end of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the use occurs and the rent is allocated). These rules do not apply if your lease specifies equal amounts of rent for each month in the lease term and all rent payments are due in the calendar year to which the rent relates (or in the preceding or following calendar year). Generally, if the special rules apply, you must use an accrual method of accounting (and time value of money principles) for your rental expenses, regardless of your overall method of accounting. In addition, in certain cases in which the IRS has determined that a lease was designed to achieve tax avoidance, you must take rent and stated or imputed interest into account under a constant rental accrual method in which the rent is treated as accruing ratably over the entire lease term.

However, they don\u2019t have to pay these taxes until July 1 of the next year (18 months later) when tax bills are issued. Under the terms of the lease, Oak becomes liable for the real estate taxes in the later year when the tax bills are issued.

Cost of Getting a Lease You may either enter into a new lease with the lessor of the property or get an existing lease from another lessee. Very often when you get an existing lease from another lessee, you must pay the previous lessee money to get the lease, besides having to pay the rent on the lease.\n\nIf you get an existing lease on property or equipment for your business, you must generally amortize any amount you pay to get that lease over the remaining term of the lease.

Business Bad Debts Introduction You have a bad debt if you cannot collect money owed to you. A bad debt is either a business bad debt or a nonbusiness bad debt. This chapter discusses only business bad debts.\n\nGenerally, a business bad debt is one that comes from operating your trade or business. You can deduct business bad debts on Schedule C (Form 1040) or your applicable business income tax return.\n\nAll other bad debts are nonbusiness bad debts and are deductible only as short-term capital losses.

{"id": "1eea76033612-249", "text": "Definition of Business Bad Debt A business bad debt is a loss from the worthlessness of a debt that was either:\n\nCreated or acquired in your trade or business, or Closely related to your trade or business when it became partly or totally worthless. A debt is closely related to your trade or business if your primary motive for incurring the debt is business related. Bad debts of a corporation (other than an S corporation) are always business bad debts.\n\nCredit sales. Business bad debts are mainly the result of credit sales to customers. Goods that have been sold, but not yet paid for, and services that have been performed, but not yet paid for, are recorded in your books as either accounts receivable or notes receivable. After a reasonable period of time, if you have tried to collect the amount due, but are unable to do so, the uncollectible part of the receivables becomes a business bad debt. Accounts or notes receivable valued at fair market value (FMV) when received are deductible only at that value, even though the FMV may be less than the face value. If you purchased an account receivable for less than its face value, and the receivable subsequently becomes worthless, the most you\u2019re allowed to deduct is the amount you paid to acquire it.\n\n. This is an Image: caution.gifYou can claim a business bad debt deduction only if the amount owed to you was previously included in gross income. This applies to amounts owed to you from all sources of taxable income, including sales, services, rents, and interest. .", "url": "https://www.irs.gov/Publication-535-(2022)-Business-Expenses.html"}

You can only claim a bad debt deduction for an uncollectible receivable if you have previously included the uncollectible amount in income. If you qualify, you can use the nonaccrual-experience method of accounting, discussed later. Under this method, you don\u2019t have to accrue income that, based on your experience, you don\u2019t expect to collect.\n\nCash method. If you use the cash method of accounting, you generally report income when you receive payment. You can\u2019t claim a bad debt deduction for amounts owed to you because you never included those amounts in income. For example, a cash basis architect can\u2019t claim a bad debt deduction if a client fails to pay the bill because the architect's fee was never included in income. Debts from a former business. If you sell your business but retain its receivables, these debts are business debts because they arose out of your trade or business. If any of these receivables subsequently become worthless, the loss is still a business bad debt. Debt acquired from a decedent. The character of a loss from debts of a business acquired from a decedent is determined in the same way as debts acquired on the purchase of a business. The executor of the decedent's estate treats any loss from the debts as a business bad debt if the debts were closely related to the decedent's trade or business when they became worthless. Otherwise, a loss from these debts becomes a nonbusiness bad debt for the decedent's estate. Liquidation.

You can generally deduct reasonable advertising expenses that are directly related to your business activities. Generally, you can\u2019t deduct amounts paid to influence legislation (for example, lobbying). For more information, see Lobbying expenses, later. You can usually deduct as a business expense the cost of institutional or goodwill advertising to keep your name before the public if it relates to business you reasonably expect to gain in the future.

A kickback is a payment for referring a client, patient, or customer. The common kickback situation occurs when money or property is given to someone as payment for influencing a third party to purchase from, use the services of, or otherwise deal with the person who pays the kickback. In many cases, the person whose business is being sought or enjoyed by the person who pays the kickback isn\u2019t aware of the payment. For example, the Yard Corporation is in the business of repairing ships. It returns 10% of the repair bills as kickbacks to the captains and chief officers of the vessels it repairs. Although this practice is considered an ordinary and necessary expense of getting business, it is clearly a violation of a state law that is generally enforced.

You\u2019ll want to make sure you register your business with the right agencies and pay the appropriate taxes.\n\nLicense, permit, and zoning rules These rules vary across states and localities. Getting licenses and permits in new locations is similar to getting them in your home state.\n\nIf you already have a permit or license from a federal agency, check with the issuing agency to confirm you can legally operate in a new state. Also, see whether your new state, county, and city governments require a new license or permit. Start by visiting your state's website.", "url": "https://www.sba.gov/Expand-to-new-locations.html"}
{"id": "36ed3ca434d8-1", "text": "Foreign qualification If you plan to expand your business to a new state, you might need to file for foreign qualification in that state. This process notifies the new state that your business is active there.\n\nTo foreign qualify, file a Certificate of Authority. Many states also require a Certificate of Good Standing from your state of formation. Each state charges a filing fee, but the amount varies by location and business structure.\n\nCheck with state offices to find out foreign qualification requirements and fees.\n\nPay taxes in new states and localities If you do business in a new state as a foreign qualified business, you\u2019ll typically need to pay taxes and annual report fees in the new state as well as your home state. The process for foreign qualified businesses to pay taxes is similar to any other business that needs to pay taxes in the state.\n\nKeep in mind that not every state and locality has a sales tax. In addition, most states have tax exemptions on certain items, such as food or clothing. If you charge sales tax, you need to be familiar with applicable rates.\n\nPay taxes for online sales If your business has a physical presence in a state \u2014 such as a store, office, or warehouse \u2014 you must collect applicable state and local sales tax from your customers in that state. If you don\u2019t have a physical presence in a particular state, you\u2019re not required to collect sales taxes.\n\nDetermining which sales tax to charge can be a challenge. Many retailers use online shopping  cart software that automatically calculates sales tax rates. Make sure your sales plan accounts for the various state rates.\n\nKnow before you grow John and Kelly planned, financed, and opened a second location for their auto repair shop. Franchising There are two primary ways you could expand your business with franchising.\n\nThe first way is to buy an existing business or franchise.

Businesses that are good candidates for franchising have a few traits in common.\n\nProduct or service is superior and appeals to potential business owners Concept and operations are easy to teach Business is easy to duplicate in new markets The federal government and many states have requirements that must be met in order for you to sell franchises, so you may want to hire an attorney. Once you've begun franchising, some states remain active in the relationship between you and your franchisees by monitoring territorial rights or limiting the transfer and renewal of your franchises.\n\nFranchising has more costs than many other types of businesses. You\u2019ll probably need to pay lawyers, accountants, and advertising staff. Don't forget about training the employees and building systems you'll need to run the franchise.\n\nNeed help?

Produce a short statement with the total requested amount and specific reasons for it.\n\nMaybe your business is cyclical \u2014 like construction or education \u2014 and could use funding to get through expected slow periods. Or maybe it needs capital to invest in new machinery or launch a product line.

Entities doing business with the federal government must use the UEI created by the system.\n\nBusinesses no longer have to go to a third-party website to obtain their identifier (DUNS number). This transition allows the government to streamline the entity identification and validation process, making it easier and less burdensome to do business with the federal government.\n\nIf your entity is already registered with SAM, your UEI has already been assigned to you. Learn how to view your UEI within SAM at the Federal Service Desk.\n\nRefer to the Guide to Getting a UEI if you want to get a UEI for your organization without having to complete a full entity registration. If you only conduct certain types of transactions, such as reporting as a sub-awardee, you may not need to complete an entity registration. Your entity may only need a UEI.\n\nNAICS code You\u2019ll also need to match your products and services to a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. NAICS codes classify businesses based on the particular product or service they supply. A business will generally have a primary NAICS code, but it can also have multiple NAICS codes if it sells multiple products and services.\n\nTo find your NAICS code, view the NAICS code list at the U.S. Census Bureau.", "url": "https://www.sba.gov/Your-small-business-must-meet-some-basic-requirements-before-you-can-compete-for-government-contracts..html"}
{"id": "421faf7fcf4b-1", "text": "Meet size standards To be eligible for government contracts reserved for small businesses, your business must meet size requirements set by the SBA. These size standards define the maximum size that a business \u2014 and its affiliates \u2014 can be to qualify as a small business for a particular contract.\n\nThe SBA assigns a size standard to each NAICS code. Most manufacturing companies with 500 employees or fewer, and most non-manufacturing businesses with average annual receipts under $7.5 million, will qualify as a small business.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions by industry. You can view these in Title 13 Part 121.201 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) or in the SBA\u2019s table of small business size standards.\n\nTo determine if your business qualifies as \"small\" for government contracting purposes, use the SBA\u2019s Size Standards Tool.\n\nRegister with SAM To participate in government contracting, you must register your business in the federal government\u2019s System for Award Management (SAM). SAM is a database that government agencies search to find contractors.\n\nUsing SAM, you\u2019ll able to certify that your business is eligible for contracts that are reserved for small businesses. You\u2019ll also be able to represent if your business is eligible for contracts under an SBA contracting program because it is disadvantaged, women owned, veteran owned, or located in an underutilized area.\n\nYour small business\u2019 profile in SAM is like a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Creating a profile that\u2019s accurate and appealing is important to winning a government contract. Make sure to use accurate, descriptive terms about your business so that contracting officials will be able to find you in search results.\n\nMaintain compliance In order to participate in government contracting, you must comply with all laws and regulations. The federal government's purchasing process is governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation.\n\nRegulations covering government contracting programs for small businesses are listed in 13 CFR 125.", "url": "https://www.sba.gov/Your-small-business-must-meet-some-basic-requirements-before-you-can-compete-for-government-contracts..html"}

{"id": "3b39b7c9165b-3", "text": "The Optimize Business Checking account is eligible for an earnings allowance to offset eligible fees and expenses, including certain service fees. To calculate your earnings allowance, we apply the earnings credit rate to the investable balance available for services in your account. The earnings credit rate is a variable rate that the Bank can change at any time. The rate appears on your client analysis statement. If your earnings allowance is greater than the total eligible fees for a given statement period, we won't credit that amount to your account or carry it forward to the following statement period. In any statement period where your fees exceed your earnings allowance, we'll debit your account or invoice you for the difference.\n\nThe first five Optimize Business Checking accounts within a billing relationship are included in the monthly maintenance fee of $75. Additional Optimize Business\u00a0Checking accounts in excess of five are $30 each. See the Business Account Fee and Information Schedule for additional business account information.\n\nFor Analyzed Accounts, transactions are defined as checks paid, withdrawals, debits, and electronic credits posted, and checks deposited electronically. Deposits processed by a teller, ATM, or mailed to the Bank may incur a separate fee. Wells Fargo Business Debit or ATM card purchases are not assessed a transaction fee by Wells Fargo. For Optimize Business Checking electronic credits are not counted as part of the 250 transactions within a billing relationship.

If the cashier's check is lost, stolen, or destroyed, you may request a stop payment and reissuance. A stop payment and reissuance can only be completed within a branch location. As a condition of stop payment and reissuance, Wells Fargo Bank will impose a $31.00 stop payment fee and require an indemnity agreement. In addition, for cashier's checks over $1,000.00, the waiting period before the stop payment and reissuance of an outstanding cashier's check may be processed is 90 days (30 days in the state of Wisconsin and 91 days in the state of New York). The waiting period can be avoided with the purchase of an acceptable surety bond. This can be purchased through Wells Fargo's approved insurance carrier or through an insurance carrier of the customer's choice. The cost of a surety bond varies depending on the amount of the bond and the insurer used. Surety bonds are subject to the insurance carrier's underwriting requirements before issuance.

Your Wells Fargo Business Debit Card comes with Zero Liability protection at no extra cost. You will be reimbursed for unauthorized card transactions when reported promptly. Contactless cards with chip technology. Wells Fargo offers business debit cards with contactless technology, which includes a chip. The contactless feature provides a speedy and secure purchase and checkout experience. With the contactless feature, you can tap your business debit card near the Contactless Symbol displayed on a merchant terminal or Wells Fargo ATM to quickly complete your transaction. The contactless card also can be used by inserting or swiping it in the terminal. When you tap to use your contactless card, the transaction is processed using the chip's advanced encryption and safeguards to help protect your contactless transaction. Look for the Contactless Symbol so you can tap to make purchases at contactless-enabled merchant terminals, transit turnstiles, and to access Wells Fargo ATMs. Learn more about contactless cards. Chip technology. Wells Fargo Debit Cards include chip technology on the front of the card, plus the traditional magnetic stripe on the back. The chip provides added security because it is extremely difficult to counterfeit or copy when inserted into a chip-enabled terminal or ATM, and does not store any personal information. If a merchant or ATM has not yet adopted chip technology, your transaction will be processed using the magnetic stripe. Debit card alerts.

Depending on the type of accounts you have, your alerts will begin one to two business days after you set them up. Alerts are then sent according to the type of transactions that trigger them. For example, when a deposit has posted, a deposit posted alert is sent usually the following business day. For certain alerts, such as when a purchase is made at a gas station, an alert is sent when the transaction is authorized. Exception: If you have set up the Access Suspended notification, we will send an alert immediately if an incorrect password has been entered multiple times and your online access is suspended.\n\nHow do I know if I have a new alert? We will send alerts to your email address or mobile device, as well as the Message Center within Wells Fargo Business Online. We recommend that you regularly check your Message Center to ensure you\u2019re receiving your Wells Fargo messages and alerts.\n\nWhy did I receive a credit card alert today for a transaction that happened on a different day? Occasionally you will receive an alert for a transaction which you made several days before. The most common reason this can happen is a merchant delay in processing your transaction. For non-urgent types of alerts, Wells Fargo processes the transaction information sent by merchants on a nightly basis. An alert is then sent to you the next business day.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/alerts/"}

A deposit hold means that although a check amount was credited to your account, it's not available for your use. Wells Fargo Bank's general policy is to make deposited funds available on the first business day after the Bank receives a deposit. In some cases, however, we may place a deposit hold on these funds and delay availability for up to 7 business days. Common reasons for placing a hold on a check or deposit include but are not limited to:\n\nAccounts with frequent overdrafts New customer High-dollar deposits that exceed the total available balance in the account Deposits of checks that have already been returned unpaid Notification to Wells Fargo by the check maker\u2019s financial institution that the check will be returned", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/deposit-hold/"}
{"id": "50913d8e5d0b-1", "text": "What happens when a deposit hold is placed on my funds? During the time a deposit hold is in effect, you should not write checks against or attempt to withdraw the held funds. If a deposit hold has been placed, we may decline withdrawals or return checks if the total amount of available funds in your account (not including the \u201chold\u201d amount) is insufficient to pay these items. If checks you have written are returned or items are paid using the funds held, they may be subject to fees.\n\nHow do you alert me when a deposit is on hold? Generally, a deposit hold is placed at the time you deposit the check. Your deposit receipt will include information about the hold. Electronic receipts may be sent through email or to your wellsfargo.com secure inbox. If a deposit hold is placed after the deposit, we\u2019ll notify you via the US Postal Service and email (if available).\n\nWhen will the funds be available? Generally, held funds will be available to you on the date shown on your deposit hold notification or deposit receipt. We\u2019ll notify you separately via US Postal Service or email if the deposited check is returned unpaid or if that date changes.\n\nWhat happens if the check is returned unpaid? If the check is returned unpaid by the bank upon which it is drawn, the amount of the check will be deducted from your account.\n\nWhat are Wells Fargo's responsibilities regarding a deposit hold? Wells Fargo is responsible for giving you prompt notice when there is a delay in the availability of your deposited funds. Additionally, if you did not receive a notice of the deposit hold at the time you made the deposit and the check you deposited is paid, we will refund any fees that were charged due to the deposit hold. To get a refund of such fees, call: Consumer Accounts 1-800-869-3557 Business Accounts 1-800-225-5935", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/deposit-hold/"}
{"id": "50913d8e5d0b-2", "text": "What are my responsibilities to Wells Fargo when there\u2019s a deposit hold? You may not use the delayed funds until they\u2019re available. To avoid fees, please don\u2019t attempt to withdraw or write checks against these funds.\n\nWhen will my deposited funds begin to earn interest? Deposit holds do not impact interest. Any deposit to an interest-bearing account will begin earning interest within two business days regardless of the length of a hold.\n\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A.

A Wells Fargo Merchant Services account enables you to process credit cards, debit cards, and electronic check transactions. These payment methods are convenient for your customers, and give you access to your funds as soon as the next business day when you settle into a Wells Fargo business deposit account. Or you can settle your Merchant Services funds to an account with another financial institution.\n\nWhy do I have to fill out an application? Why do you have to check my credit? We ask merchants to complete an application so we can obtain information to assess the risk level that your business or organization may have when processing card payments. We review your credit as part of this assessment process.\n\nCan internationally-based merchants open a merchant account? No. Merchants physically located outside of the U.S. cannot process transactions with a Wells Fargo Merchant Services account. Currently, only merchants with a physical business address in the U.S. may process transactions with a Wells Fargo Merchant Services account.\n\nWhat kind of credit and debit cards can I accept? Common cards you can accept are Visa\u00ae, Mastercard\u00ae, Discover\u00ae, American Express\u00ae, and JCB. American Express and JCB are subject to processing network approval.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}

If the legal ownership of the new store is the same as your existing merchant account with us, and it is also the same type of business, we can open an additional location under your current merchant account unless you are opening an e-commerce/online location.\u00a0 If the business type of your new store is different, you will need to set up a new merchant account for the new location.  If you are planning to open another location or need assistance, please contact our Wells Fargo Merchant Services Customer Service representatives at 1-800-451-5817.\n\nI want to accept a different card type than Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express.

{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-4", "text": "Fees and pricing\n\nWhat are interchange charges? These are the variable fees charged by the payment networks for processing transactions. Wells Fargo pays these fees on its customers' behalf, directly to issuing banks (the companies that issue payment cards to your customers) and the payment networks, such as Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express, in compensation for facilitating the exchange of information and funds between your bank and your customers\u2019 banks. Factors that affect interchange charges include card type, information contained in the transaction, and how/when the transaction was processed. Depending on how you are priced, interchange charges may or may not appear on your merchant statement.\n\nWhat are service charges? Service charges are the amounts charged to authorize, process and settle card transactions. The service charges you pay are determined by a variety of factors such as:  Your payment processing methods (face-to-face with your customers, online, by phone or mail) The types of cards your customers use to pay you  Service charges may appear under either the Fees or Service Charges section on your merchant statement.\n\nWhat are monthly service charges? A monthly service fee charge covers reporting and analytics, 24/7 support, advanced risk and fraud monitoring, and may include dispute management and payment gateway access.\n\nHow are my fees collected? The fees are collected monthly by an automatic deduction from the checking or savings account you specified.\n\nTransaction process", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-5", "text": "Transaction process\n\nHow does the card payment process work? Here is how the card payment process works:  Customer places an order with the merchant. Merchant submits the order/transaction via their payment/point-of-sale system (POS such as a terminal, cash register, payment gateway, software). The system forwards the payment authorization request to the card issuing bank to verify the customer\u2019s card account and funds availability. The authorization (or decline) response is returned via the system to the merchant. This process typically averages around three seconds. Upon receipt of the payment authorization, the merchant fulfills the customer's order. Merchant then \"settles the batch\" of transactions through their POS system. The POS system requests from the merchant's processor to get a group or \"batch\" of authorized settled transactions. The Processor credits the funds to the merchant's account. POS systems are set up to automatically batch transactions each day. Alternatively they can be set for manual batching, which requires the merchant to close their batch of transactions on a regular basis. Wells Fargo deposits transaction funds into the merchant's deposit account. When settling to a Wells Fargo business deposit account, funds are available as soon as the next business day.\n\nWhat is an authorization? An authorization confirms that the cardholder number is valid for an approval on a sale amount. Approval of an authorization request by the issuing bank is confirmation that the cardholder has funds available to make the purchase. It is not a guarantee of payment.\n\nWhat information is included on my statement? Your statement will include a summary of your transaction processing information received, processed, and funded to your checking account. The statement can be used to determine if the deposits and funding records balance back to your internal business reporting. The recap statement is used for merchants with multiple locations. Learn more about how to read your statement in our Guide to Processing Card Payments (PDF).\n\nE\n\n\n\ncommerce processing", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-6", "text": "E\n\n\n\ncommerce processing\n\nWhat is a payment gateway and how does it work? The payment gateway is a link between your website (or the website hosting your goods or services) and your payment processor (Wells Fargo). When your customer makes an online purchase, the information from your website must be sent through a payment gateway to obtain an authorization and for a payment card transaction to be completed. Payment gateways work with a variety of e-commerce service providers such as shopping carts and digital wallets. Wells Fargo offers e-commerce processing through Authorize.net\u00ae, a Visa solution. You will need to agree to additional terms and conditions with Authorize.net for these services.\n\nWhy do I have to post a refund/service return policy? We want to make sure your customers understand fully the product/service they're purchasing and any courses of action should they be unhappy with their purchase. By including your refund/service return policy on your website, you help reduce the likelihood of disputes from your customers. Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express also require a refund/service return policy.\n\nI already have a shopping cart. Why do I need a payment gateway? The shopping cart collects items from your customer, adds up the item's costs, calculates taxes and shipping costs, and provides a total amount to the customer. A payment gateway's function is to collect the purchaser's name, address, credit card number, and expiration date. The payment gateway securely sends this information and verifies that the purchaser has enough funds in their account at that time to pay for products ordered.\n\nCan I manually process transactions? Yes. You can manually process transactions with the virtual terminal feature included in all gateways offered by Wells Fargo Merchant Services.\n\nVirtual terminal\n\nWhat is a virtual terminal? For merchants looking for an alternative way to start taking payments, a virtual terminal enables you to take payments by manually keying card information into a secure site via a web browser on your own device. No development work or special equipment needed.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-7", "text": "Does a virtual terminal check AVS or CVV on the authorization? Not automatically. Merchants must initiate Address Verification Service (AVS) checks and ask customers for their Card Verification Value (CVV), Credit Card Validation (CCV), Card Verification Value2 (CVV2), etc. values.\n\nCan you import or export transaction data with a virtual terminal? You cannot import or export transaction data with a virtual terminal; however, some gateways have the ability to upload transactions in batches for processing or download batch transaction reporting.\n\nWhat is a virtual point of sale? A virtual POS is a browser-based application (like a virtual terminal) that is paired with a card reader to process in-person payments. Depending on your card reader\u2019s capabilities and type of card, a virtual POS allows you to accept card payments by dipping, tapping, or swiping the card. If the card reader cannot read the card\u2019s chip or magnetic stripe, you can manually enter the transaction data into the virtual POS application.\n\nPayment Card Industry (PCI) data security standards\n\nWhat are the PCI Data Security Standards? The PCI Data Security Standards are payment card network (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express) and industry mandated requirements for handling of credit card information, classification of merchants, and validation of merchant compliance. Merchants are responsible for the security of cardholder data and must be careful not to store certain types of data on their systems or the systems of their third party service providers. Merchants are also responsible for any damages or liability that may occur as a result of a data security breach or other non-compliance with the PCI Data Security Standards. The information security principles contained within these standards are based on ISO 17799, the internationally-recognized standard for information security practices.\n\nDo I need to comply with PCI Data Security Standards? Yes. The program encompasses all merchants and third-party service providers that store, process, or transmit cardholder data.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-8", "text": "What are the benefits of being in compliance with the PCI Data Security Standards? It is good business practice to adhere to the PCI Data Security Standards and protect cardholder information. Additionally, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover may impose fines on their member banking institutions when merchants do not comply with PCI Data Security Standards. You are contractually obligated to indemnify and reimburse us, as your acquirer, for such fines. Please note such fines could be significant, especially if your business is compromised and you have not been validated as compliant.\n\nWhat is cardholder data? Cardholder data is any personally identifiable data associated with a cardholder. This could be an account number, expiration date, name, address, social security number, etc. The PCI Data Security Standards apply to all cardholder data stored, processed, or transmitted.\n\nWhat is a Compliance Classification Level and how is a merchant\u2019s compliance classification level determined? A merchant's Compliance Classification Level is determined by annual transaction volume. The volume calculation done for you will be based on the gross number of Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover transactions processed through your merchant account. It is important to note that the PCI level is based on the annual transaction volume for one card brand. A PCI level is not determined by combining the transaction volume of different card brands.\n\nWhat is an IP-based POS environment? The point-of-sale (POS) environment is the environment in which a transaction takes place at a merchant location (e.g., retail store, restaurant, hotel property, gas station, supermarket, or other point-of-sale location). An Internet protocol (IP)-based POS environment is one in which transactions are stored, processed, or transmitted on IP-based systems, or systems communicating via transmission control protocol (TCP).", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-9", "text": "Could my compliance requirements change? Yes. As your transaction volume changes, as your payment solution changes, and as payment network and industry rules change, your compliance requirements may change. It is your responsibility to be continuously aware of the data security requirements that currently apply to you.\n\nData store protocol\n\nWhat rules apply if a merchant does not store cardholder data? If a merchant does not store cardholder data, the PCI Data Security Standards still apply to the environment that transmits or processes cardholder data. This includes any service providers that a merchant uses.\n\nCompliance assessment\n\nWhat is a self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ)? The PCI Self-Assessment Questionnaire is available for download on the PCI Data Security Standards Council website. If a business chooses to enroll with one of the PCI Security Standards Council Qualified Security Assessors to perform the system perimeter scan, they may complete the approved assessor's Compliance Questionnaire in lieu of the version posted on the PCI Council website.\n\nWhat is an external vulnerability scan? An external vulnerability scan involves an automated tool that checks a merchant's or service provider's systems for vulnerabilities. The tool will conduct a non-intrusive scan to remotely review networks and Web applications based on the external-facing Internet protocol (IP) addresses provided by the merchant or service provider. The scan will identify vulnerabilities in operating systems, services, and devices that could be used by hackers to target the company's private network. The tool will not require the merchant or service provider to install any software on their systems, and it will not perform any denial-of-service attacks.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-10", "text": "Who needs to conduct an an external vulnerability scan? The external vulnerability scan is applicable to all merchants and service providers with external-facing IP addresses. Even if an entity does not offer Web-based transactions, there are other services that make systems Internet accessible. Basic functions such as e-mail and employee Internet access will result in the Internet-accessibility of a company's network. These paths to and from the Internet can provide unprotected pathways into merchant and service provider systems if not properly controlled. If a merchant or service provider does not have any external-facing IP addresses, they will only be required to complete the Report On Compliance or the Self Assessment Questionnaire, as applicable.\n\nIs the merchant responsible for compliance if they have outsourced the storage, processing, or transmission of cardholder data to a service provider? Merchants should deal only with PCI Data Security Standards-compliant service providers. If there are service providers handling cardholder data on a merchant's behalf, the merchant is still responsible for the security of this data and must ensure that contracts with these service providers specifically include PCI Data Security Standards compliance as a condition of business. Per payment network rules, you must inform Wells Fargo if you are using a service provider. Click on this link for a list of PCI Compliant Service Providers.\n\nDo merchants need to include their service providers in the scope of their PCI Data Security Standards review? Yes. Merchants are responsible for the compliance of their service providers.\n\nPenalties for non\n\n\n\ncompliance\n\nAre there fines associated with non-compliance of the PCI Data Security Standards? Yes. Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover may impose fines on their member banking institutions when merchants do not comply with PCI Data Security Standards. You are contractually obligated to indemnify and reimburse us, as your acquirer, for such fines. Please note such fines could be significant.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-11", "text": "Are there fines if cardholder data is compromised? Yes. If cardholder data that you are responsible for is compromised, you may be subject to fines and other liabilities, including the following:  Potential fines (at the discretion of Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, or other card companies). All fraud losses incurred from the use of the compromised account numbers from the date of compromise forward.\u00a0 Cost of re-issuing cards associated with the compromise. Cost of any additional fraud prevention/detection activities required by the payment networks (i.e. a forensic audit) or costs incurred by credit card issuers associated with the compromise (i.e. additional monitoring of system for fraudulent activity).

If you have questions, please contact our Wells Fargo Merchant Services Customer Service representatives at 1-800-451-5817.\n\nChip card technology\n\nWhat is the customer experience when they pay with a chip card? For card present or in-person payments, when a customer presents a chip card, the merchant asks them to insert it into the slot in the PIN pad or terminal, or tap if the card supports contactless payments. The terminal guides the customer through the process. The customer will be prompted to authorize the amount, and may be prompted to enter their PIN or provide a signature. The chip card must remain inserted in the slot through the entire transaction. If it is removed too soon, the transaction will be cancelled.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-12", "text": "What does the payment experience look like for restaurants and other merchants that accept tips? Accepting tips from a chip card may vary depending on a merchant\u2019s point of sale. For example, wireless point-of-sale solutions can simplify the payment process for restaurants since a server can take a wireless chip compatible terminal to the table to collect payment and tip from the customer. Wells Fargo offers POS solutions that cater to restaurants and allow a merchant to capture tips, table mapping, etc.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-13", "text": "Once I upgrade my terminal equipment to accept chip cards, will I be able to accept and process chip card transactions? Will I be able to accept magnetic stripe cards? Depending on your POS device, your terminal can assist you in dip, tap, swipe or even keying in a card for payment. Occasionally you may come across a damaged chip, or a chip card that is not ready to be used. In these scenarios, the chip card terminal or PIN pad may prompt you to swipe the card. The transaction will be processed as a magnetic stripe transaction, and if the card issuer approves the transaction, the issuer is liable for any chip card-related fraud. Once you have upgraded your terminal equipment with both chip compatible hardware and software, it is important to:  Closely monitor your chip card transactions Ensure that staff are properly trained on merchant acceptance procedures for chip cards  Contact Wells Fargo Merchant Services Customer Service at 1-800-451-5817 or your Wells Fargo Merchant Services specialist immediately for a replacement device and to avoid any related fraud chargebacks to your account if:  Your currently chip compatible terminal or PIN pad suddenly stops allowing you to insert chip cards.

Businesses that accept contactless payments can accept digital payments such as Apple Pay, Google PayTM, and Samsung Pay\u00ae. To accept digital wallet payments \u2014 also known as digital payments or digital wallets \u2014 at the point of sale, a terminal enabled with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology is required.

{"id": "2ea48a92e3be-6", "text": "Is an overdraft different from a returned item? Yes. A returned item (also known as a non-sufficient funds (NSF) item) occurs when Wells Fargo returns an item (such as a check or other transaction presented for payment) unpaid because there is not enough money in the account to cover it (meaning we do not pay the transaction). Our overdraft fee for items paid into overdraft is $35 per item. We charge no more than four overdraft fees per business day for Business accounts. We do not charge a returned item/non-sufficient funds (NSF) fee for items we return unpaid. However, merchants or other banks may charge fees for returned items.\n\nCan I make a deposit or transfer to avoid an overdraft fee? Yes.

Debit Card Overdraft Service allows us to authorize, at our discretion, ATM and everyday (one-time) debit card transactions if there isn\u2019t enough money in your checking account (or in accounts linked for Overdraft Protection) to cover them.

A minimum of $25 (or the exact amount of the negative balance if over $25) will be transferred from your savings account or credit card.

Zelle\u00ae is a convenient way to send and receive money with friends, family and other people or small businesses you know and trust. You can send money to almost anyone with an eligible U.S.-based bank account using just their email address or U.S. mobile phone number. When you enroll with Zelle\u00ae using Wells Fargo Business Online\u00ae or Wells Fargo Mobile\u00ae app, we establish a connection between your email address or U.S. mobile phone number and your eligible Wells Fargo checking or savings account.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/zelle/"}
{"id": "a45ef20a0209-1", "text": "Who can I send money to? You can use Zelle\u00ae to send money to almost any person or small business with an eligible U.S.-based bank account. Eligibility requirements may vary depending on where your recipient banks. For your protection, you should only use Zelle\u00ae when sending money to people or small businesses you know and trust. To send or receive money with a small business, both parties must be enrolled with Zelle\u00ae directly through their U.S.-based financial institution\u2019s online or mobile banking experience. Check with your recipient to ensure their correct email address or U.S. mobile phone number is enrolled with Zelle\u00ae so they can receive money.\n\nDoes Wells Fargo or Zelle\u00ae offer a protection program? Neither Wells Fargo nor Zelle\u00ae offers a protection program for any authorized payments made with Zelle\u00ae \u2013 for example, if you do not receive the item you paid for or the item is not as described or as you expected. Zelle\u00ae is intended to replace instances where cash and checks are being exchanged, so you do not have the same protections associated with a credit card or a debit card transaction, such as the ability to dispute authorized payments. Once you send money with Zelle\u00ae, you cannot cancel the payment if your recipient has already enrolled. We recommend you only send money to known and trusted recipients when using Zelle\u00ae.\n\nIs there a fee for Zelle\u00ae? Wells Fargo does not charge a fee to send or receive money with Zelle\u00ae through Wells Fargo Online\u00ae or Wells Fargo Mobile\u00ae. However, when using Zelle\u00ae on a mobile device, your mobile carrier\u2019s message and data rates may apply.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/zelle/"}
{"id": "a45ef20a0209-2", "text": "How much money can I send and receive with Zelle\u00ae? For your security, we restrict the amount of money you can send to recipients. These limits will vary based on a number of factors, such as the type of funding account you use, your account and online banking history, your recipient and the transaction history for each recipient. If there is a change to your recipient's enrollment with Zelle\u00ae, the limits may be adjusted. Send limits  There are rolling daily and 30-day limits for established recipients. Note that the amount of money you can send to a new recipient may initially be lower. However, we may adjust the limit when you send subsequent payments to the same recipient. Receiving limits  We do not limit how much money you can receive with Zelle\u00ae using your email address or U.S. mobile phone number. However, the sender may be subject to limits on how much they can send you, based on the policies of their financial institution or payment network. You can receive up to $10,000 per day into each eligible account when someone sends you money using your account number. Payments sent or received using an account number are subject to limits governed by Wells Fargo and not Zelle\u00ae. For more information about Zelle\u00ae sending and receiving limits with Wells Fargo, see the Zelle\u00ae Transfer Service Addendum. These limits apply only to Zelle\u00ae transactions when initiated from Wells Fargo Online\u00ae or Wells Fargo Mobile\u00ae app.\n\nWhen will my payment arrive with Zelle\u00ae?

U.S. mobile numbers and email addresses can be enrolled to receive money with only one financial institution at a time. If any in your profile are already enrolled elsewhere, you can transfer the enrollment so money sent to that mobile number or email address will be deposited into your Wells Fargo account instead.

The device, which can be carried on a keychain, generates a random 6-digit Personal Access Code that is used to sign on to these services. The Personal Access Code changes every 60 seconds.\n\nHow does the RSA SecurID device work? The RSA SecurID device generates a random 6-digit numeric Personal Access Code every 60 seconds. Access to certain Wells Fargo services is synchronized between this Personal Access Code and our internal security system. Plus, your RSA SecurID device will work anywhere you have access to Wells Fargo Online\u00ae services.\n\nHow does the RSA SecurID device make my online transactions more secure? Your transactions are more secure because the device adds an extra layer of password protection. The Personal Access Code is a random number that changes every 60 seconds and each code can only be used once \u2014 making it almost impossible for someone to know your Personal Access Code.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//online-banking/securid/"}
{"id": "35191228c093-1", "text": "When is the RSA SecurID device required?

Call Customer Service at 1-888-245-8454 and a representative will assist you.\n\nIf I lose the RSA SecurID device will I have to pay for a replacement? No. There are no costs or fees associated with the replacement of a RSA SecurID device.\n\nAm I at risk if my RSA SecurID device gets lost or stolen? Unless someone also has your Wells Fargo Online\u00ae username and password, they will not be able to access services that are protected by the RSA SecurID device. However, you should report the lost or stolen device as soon as possible. Once you report a lost or stolen device, it is deactivated.\n\nHow long will it take for the RSA SecurID device to be delivered to me? Once you complete the enrollment process for any service that uses the device for authentication, it will be delivered to your business address on file in 14-16 business days.\n\nIf I cancel my service, what do I do with my RSA SecurID device(s)? You do not need to return the device. We recommend keeping the device in a safe place in case you reactivate your service, or choose to take advantage of new services that use RSA SecurID technology in the future.\n\nWill the device work anywhere? Yes. The device does not use a wireless signal to synchronize with Wells Fargo\u2019s internal security system, so it will work anywhere you have access to Wells Fargo Online services.\n\nIs the device assigned per-person or per-company? Each RSA SecurID device is registered to an individual person and cannot be shared.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//online-banking/securid/"}

About the PPP loan and loan forgiveness What are the terms of the loan and are there any fees? The term or period of the PPP loan is stated in your promissory note and is either two or five years. The PPP loan will accrue interest at an annual rate of 1%. No payment is due during the deferral period, which ends:\n\nOn the date when the SBA makes a decision on your application for forgiveness, or; 10 months after the last day of the covered period, if you have not applied for forgiveness.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//paycheck-protection-forgiveness/faq/"}
{"id": "c707f47cc11e-1", "text": "If your loan is forgiven, any interest accrued during the deferral period is eligible for forgiveness. There is no penalty for loan pre-payment, however partial or full pre-payment may impact forgiveness. After the deferral period, any balance that is not forgiven (including any accrued interest on the unforgiven portion) will become a term loan with monthly payments due up to the maturity date and with an annual interest rate of 1%. For each payment of principal, interest, and/or fees that has not been paid in full within 15 (fifteen) days after its due date, you will be assessed a late charge of $15 or five percent (5%) of the amount due, whichever is greater. There are no annual or documentation fees associated with the loan. However, if you are late on payments after the deferral period, you may be liable for late fees for any portion of the loan that is not forgiven. You will receive a loan statement before any payment is due, so you can plan accordingly. Please refer to the SBA site for more details on the covered period, the term of the loan and other loan forgiveness details.\n\nWhat is the deferral period? Your deferral period ends:\n\nOn the date when the SBA makes a decision on your application for forgiveness, or; 10 months after the last day of the covered period, if you have not applied for forgiveness.\n\nNo payment of PPP loan principal, interest, and fees is due during the deferral period. If you received your promissory note before June 5, 2020, it may indicate that your first payment is due 6 months from the date of the note. The PPP Flexibility Act (signed on June 5, 2020) extended the deferral period, so you can disregard the original 6 month period referenced in the promissory note. You will receive a loan statement before any payment is due, so you can plan accordingly.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//paycheck-protection-forgiveness/faq/"}
{"id": "c707f47cc11e-2", "text": "What are Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) and advances and how do they affect loan forgiveness? Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) are direct loans, while EIDL advances are grants. The SBA set the maximum EIDL advance at $10,000. EIDL advances will no longer be deducted by the SBA from forgiveness amounts. You may be able to refinance EIDL loans funded between 1/31/2020 and 4/3/2020 with your first PPP loan. You cannot refinance an EIDL loan with a Second Draw PPP Loan. For any questions related to the SBA EIDL program, or to obtain an EIDL loan payoff amount, contact the SBA Disaster Loan Servicing Center at (800) 736-6048 or refer to the SBA.\n\nAre PPP loans eligible for loan forgiveness? PPP loans, in whole or in part, are eligible for loan forgiveness if funds were used for certain eligible business expenses.

At that point, loan payments on any amount not forgiven, including any interest, will become due and you will need to start making monthly payments, if applicable.

A CD is a financial product that usually pays a fixed interest rate for a set period of time, ranging from a few months to several years. This period of time is known as a \u201cterm\". By depositing your money into a CD for a set term, you lock in your initial deposit principal and interest rate until your money matures. You earn interest from the date of your opening deposit up to your maturity date. Your interest compounds daily and is generally paid monthly, although interest payments made quarterly, semi-annually, annually, or at maturity are also available. Interest can be re-deposited to the CD, transferred to a Wells Fargo checking or savings account, or paid to you via check if your CD has a minimum balance of $5,000. Benefits of CDs There are a number of reasons you may want to open a CD:\n\nInterest rates. CDs typically pay higher interest rates than other deposit products. Higher CD rates may be available for longer terms or larger deposited amounts. Guaranteed return. Since the interest rate of a Fixed Rate CD is set at account opening and does not change until the CD matures, you know exactly how much money you will earn during the term of your CD. Security. Your funds are FDIC-insured up to the maximum applicable limits.\n\nYou can withdraw your funds early if you need to, but you may be assessed an early withdrawal penalty or a Regulation D penalty. See additional details in the Wells Fargo CD rate and penalty disclosures below. What happens when your CD matures? Approximately one month before your CD matures, you\u2019ll be sent a notice reminding you of the maturity date. At maturity, you'll have a seven calendar day grace period to renew or make any of the following changes:", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//savings/time-account/"}

{"id": "36c7a573c7d4-0", "text": "How To Protect Intellectual Property | Wells Fargo\n\nSkip to main content\n\nDiverse Businesses\n\nWomen Entrepreneurs\n\nSmall Business Resources\n\nRunning your Business\n\nGrowing your Business\n\nMoney and your Business\n\nSearch\n\nGo\n\nIntellectual property: What it is, how to protect it\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nMonitor ideas, secrets, and branding \u2014 and ways to do it. As a business owner, you manage many assets on a daily basis, but you may be overlooking an important one: intellectual property. Your intellectual property includes the intangible assets you create for your business, such as names, designs, and automated processes. And just like tangible possessions \u2014 like supplies, equipment, buildings, and inventory \u2014 your intellectual property contributes to the value and success of your business. So it needs to be monitored and protected. Here\u2019s a breakdown of common types of intellectual property and tips on how you can protect these assets. Trademarks Trademarks are the words, phrases, and symbols that differentiate your brand from others in your industry. They must be distinctive and used in commerce to sell or promote a product or service in order to qualify as trademarks. Examples:\n\nCompany and product names\n\nSlogans and taglines\n\nLogos and symbols\n\nBrand colors", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//wells-fargo-works/planning-operations/security-fraud-protection/four-examples-of-intellectual-property/"}
{"id": "36c7a573c7d4-1", "text": "Company and product names\n\nSlogans and taglines\n\nLogos and symbols\n\nBrand colors\n\nHow you can protect them: Trademarks may be registered with the federal government or your state government. Federally registered trademarks protect your rights throughout the U.S., while state-registered trademarks protect your rights only within the state\u2019s territory. While you\u2019re not required to register a trademark, having a registered trademark can make it easier to challenge anyone who infringes on your trademark rights. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) provides information on how to register your trademarks at the state or national level. Federal trademarks last as long as you use them with the public to promote your goods or services. Trademark applications generally cost between $250 and $350 per class of goods or services. To see if your desired trademark is available, you can begin searching the USPTO website or with a general internet search. A trademark lawyer can help you do a more detailed search to determine the availability of your desired trademark. Copyrights A copyright grants you legal rights to anything you create that expresses or embodies an idea. It gives you exclusive rights to copy, distribute, reproduce, display, and license the work. Examples:\n\nSoftware\n\nArchitectural designs\n\nGraphic arts\n\nVideo and sound recordings\n\nBooks and blog articles\n\nDatabases", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//wells-fargo-works/planning-operations/security-fraud-protection/four-examples-of-intellectual-property/"}
{"id": "36c7a573c7d4-2", "text": "Architectural designs\n\nGraphic arts\n\nVideo and sound recordings\n\nBooks and blog articles\n\nDatabases\n\nHow you can protect them: Like trademarks, you have some rights to your original work without registering the copyright at the U.S. Copyright Office. However, registering can give you more leverage if you ever need to take an infringer to court. For instance, if an employee writes an article or takes a photo within the scope of their employment, the employer is the copyright owner automatically. However, an independent contractor who writes an article or takes a photo will be the copyright owner of that asset unless they transfer the copyright through a written contract. As with trademarks, registering them officially can give you more leverage in the event of a dispute. A copyright empowers you to profit from your creative assets. You can sell your copyrighted assets and lease them in exchange for license fees and royalties. A new copyright owned by an individual typically lasts 70 years after the death of the copyright owner. A copyright owned by a limited liability company (LLC) or other legal entity will last 95 years from the first date the work was used with the public. You can file to register a copyright with the United States Copyright Office. The current online application fee for basic registrations is $45 to $65. Patents Patents are granted for new, useful inventions, and they will give you the right to prevent others from making, using, or selling your invention. Examples:\n\nUtility patents: for tangible inventions, such as products, machines, devices, and composite materials, as well as new and useful processes Design patents: the ornamental designs on manufactured products Plant patents: new varieties of plants", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//wells-fargo-works/planning-operations/security-fraud-protection/four-examples-of-intellectual-property/"}
{"id": "36c7a573c7d4-3", "text": "How you can protect them: Patent applications can be filed in the United States with the USPTO, and internationally in the patent office of the applicable country or region. U.S. utility and plant patents have a term of 20 years, while design patents have a term of 15 years. Patents require a nonrefundable filing fee, along with issue, service, and maintenance fees. This can add up to thousands of dollars, but some small businesses qualify for discounts. Before submitting your patent application, you can (but are not required to) search existing patents and published patent applications to see if your concept has comparatively novel features. A patent lawyer can help you do a more thorough search to determine the availability of patent protection for your concept. They can also help you investigate whether any third parties have patents that could prevent you from bringing your product or service to market. Trade secrets A trade secret is a piece of confidential business information whose secrecy gives you an advantage over your competitors. Examples:\n\nFormulas\n\nPatterns\n\nMethods, techniques, and processes", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//wells-fargo-works/planning-operations/security-fraud-protection/four-examples-of-intellectual-property/"}
{"id": "36c7a573c7d4-4", "text": "Formulas\n\nPatterns\n\nMethods, techniques, and processes\n\nHow you can protect them: Though trade secrets cannot be registered, they are protected through internal policies to ensure the secrecy is maintained. Some examples of ways to protect trade secrets include internal policies that restrict access to the trade secret, employment agreements, and non-disclosure agreements. You can take legal action against those who misappropriate your trade secrets. Get started: Put protections in your business plan Intellectual property rights can help you establish your brand identity, profit off your unique assets, and prevent others from using your creations. Making them part of your business plan can help ensure nothing\u2019s missed. Start by listing all your intellectual property assets, then consider which assets need to be protected. Budget for the time and money you\u2019ll need to properly secure the rights to your creations, and outline how you plan to protect your intellectual assets. Finally, set deadlines for research, filing, and finalizing these steps and work toward them as you would any other business goal.
