{"id": "77701ace068f-1", "text": "Go Supporting Small Business Owners\n0 ideas for small business staffing January 2023 These action-oriented ideas help take some of the guesswork out of bringing on new employees or letting them go. The right team is an essential part of growing a small business, which means how you hire and fire employees can be key to your success. But for empathetic leaders, including those who focus on potential and view their business as an extended family, this process can be especially challenging. Consider these 10 tips (six for hiring and four for firing) as you build your team. Tips for hiring There's a lot that goes into the decision to hire  including money. The average cost per hire is more than $4,000, per the Society for Human Resource Managers. To make that investment successful, it's important to consider the who, when, and how  as well as the role itself. 1. Determine the workload. Write down a list of tasks that aren't getting done that you expect a new hire to do. Examine if it's a cohesive role. 2. Set your budget. Think about what salary you can afford and then be sure to price in onboarding or training, employment insurance, and taxes like Social Security and Medicare. 3. Assess your options. Depending on the workload and your budget, explore the pros and cons of the different types of employeessalaried, hourly, temporary, intern, or contracted. Start to think about the type of person that would be a good fit for the role. 4. Cast a wide net. Start with a compelling job description and post to job sites, message boards, and even social media. This can help you find candidates outside your immediate network, which is a good way to boost diversity and gain exposure to new people and ideas that can help your business.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/10-ideas-for-small-business-staffing/"}
{"id": "77701ace068f-2", "text": "Ask for and follow through on any references they offer. It can be easy to skip these steps as a small business owner, but due diligence at this stage can pay off down the road. 5. Provide measurable objectives. This helps you match candidate skills to the position. Plus, you establish clear expectations that can help you define success later on. 6. Test the waters. If you're not sure about the role you're looking to fill or the skill sets you need, start with a consultant or freelancer. Either hire the person on a per-project basis or invite a candidate to work with you for a day (paid, of course) to see whether they're a good fit. Websites that pair companies and jobs with freelancers  such as Guru or Upwork  can help you find someone with the right experience levels and within your budget. 7. Weigh your opportunity costs. When you continue to invest in the wrong employee, you're missing out on a chance to hire the right employee who could help advance your business. 8. Analyze the fit. If an employee is a bad fit for a role, letting them go may mean they find a new job better suited to their skills. 9. Stick to facts. One benefit of clearly defining the jobs you hire for (tip five), is that it makes it easier to explain underperformance if it happens. If you've discussed the issues and haven't seen improvement, it may be appropriate to part ways. 10. Ask for help. It can be challenging to handle tough decisions on your own. If you need insight or advice, consult with a mentor, fellow business owner, or confidant. Just be sure to protect any personal details.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/10-ideas-for-small-business-staffing/"}

If you're just starting a business or if you're a sole proprietor, figuring out how to separate the expenses tied to your business from your personal finances can take some getting used to. It can also take time to open business accounts and get the systems in place to properly track your business financials. But that separation is important  it can help you determine how healthy your business is, and it makes life much easier around tax time. Follow three steps to help you create healthy boundaries between your accounts that may pay off in the long run. 1. Track expenses To create a successful business, it's critical to understand your costs. But for business owners who are just starting out, it's common to use things you have on hand or to pay for supplies with your personal accounts. This makes it harder to estimate the true cost of producing your goods or services, as well as your real operating costs.

Additionally, you'll start to get a more accurate read on what it costs to run your business, which can help you price your products and services fairly. Underestimating your costs can lead you to price your products or services too low. Overestimating expenses, on the other hand, might make your business seem less profitable than it is, which could be an issue if you ever decide to seek financing.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/3-steps-to-separating-business-and-personal-finances/"}

You can start by earmarking a personal account for this, but as your business grows, consider upgrading to accounts designed to serve small businesses. 2. Track income It can be tempting to add income generated from a new business to any other income you might be making, especially if you're paid in cash or working as a sole proprietor. However, keeping this income separate is important for both tax purposes and your ability to build and grow your business. Keep a log of every sale you make and how you're paid. These logs can be as simple as a notebook or a spreadsheet. This can help you see how much revenue you're generating from your business, and it can help you identify patterns. Do you make more money on weekends or when the weather is bad? They'll also help you at tax time. Generally, business owners must file quarterly tax estimates. You can base these payments on your previous year's earnings, but it can improve your cash flow to use real records of your income and expenses for the quarter. 3. Look for opportunities Keeping good, separate records can help you establish a baseline for what normal\u201d is, so you can start to think about what growth looks like. Consider these questions as a starting point: Are these sales sustainable? Analyze whether you can keep sales consistent each month. Are you making a profit? Subtract your expenses from your income. If you're making more than you're spending, you might take the profits as personal income or reinvest the money back into your business. What does growth look like?

If you're running your business in addition to another job, detailed records can help you figure out if and when to take the plunge and work on your business full-time. For this decision, take a close look at your personal expenses as well to see if cutting back might mean you're able to make the shift sooner.

{"id": "d1e7fb3358a7-1", "text": "Supporting Small Business Owners 4 questions to ask yourself before asking for money January 2023 Before you apply for loans or pitch to investors, you need to be clear about how much you need and why. Use these tips to get clearer on your goals. When we say, Don't shortchange yourself,\u201d we mean it. Businesses need capital to grow, yet just 25% of women entrepreneurs seek funding, compared to 34% of men. When they do ask for funding, women ask for $35,000 less than men do, on average. Not only can that limit your growth in the immediate future, but it can affect you in the long term, too. Business growth improves business value, and that can set you up to receive more funding down the road. If you're ready to get growing, you can use these questions and insights to help you determine just how much money you'd like to ask for. Keep in mind that there's no magic number or equation. But there are considerations around what you want to spend on, how much that may cost, when you want to get started, and whether you're in a position to ask for it right now. Also use the worksheet How much money should you ask for? (PDF) to capture the details and do the math so you can make a well-informed choice. What do I need the money for? Homing in on why you want the money will help you figure out the amount you need and what type of loan to seek. The first step? Make a wish list of improvements, whether it's purchasing new equipment, hiring additional staff to meet increasing demand or open an additional location, or stocking extra inventory to hedge against supply chain problems. This may sound basic but clarifying the purpose for the money will help you figure out not just the amount, but also how to present your goals to a would-be lender, banker, or investor.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/4-questions-to-ask-yourself-before-asking-for-money/"}

It may seem fun to get the latest tech gadget, for instance, but if it won't save or make you more money than it costs, you may want to go for something more practical. When do I want to get started? Now think about the timing for each desired project or purchase: Is this something you want or need to do ASAP  or can it wait a bit? The timing can also affect the type of funding you seek. For instance, funding new equipment or renting a new location is a large capital commitment that might be suited to a long-term business loan with repayment terms of 3 to 10 years. On the other hand, if you need to stock up on inventory quickly to prepare for a big order, a short-term business loan with repayment terms of 1 year or less might be more suitable.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/4-questions-to-ask-yourself-before-asking-for-money/"}

You'll need a clear idea of what your business is currently worth in order to make a pitch to lenders or investors  and after recent upheavals, the number may be very different from what it was a year or two ago. How much will it cost me? Once you've clarified what you need the money for and when, you're ready to move to the next step: naming your desired amount. There's no one right answer for this, as the right amount to ask for depends on your business needs, credit history, and risk tolerance. To make an educated ask, first do some research to get an estimate of how much your goals or improvements will cost you  at the time you plan to buy or make them. For example, if you want to buy a building but you aren't ready to do so until next year, consider that the market could go up or down. (It's good practice to build in some wiggle room; that way if prices go up drastically, you're still on track.) How much debt can I afford to take on?

Your business credit rating affects the amount you can borrow and the interest rate, but so does your personal credit score, since you're an entrepreneur. Your long-term business plan. If you haven't fleshed out or re-calculated these goals recently, it's a good idea to do so now. Create milestones with cash flow projections over the next three years, and think about future cash flow patterns, too. Some businesses take out as much as possible  only to find that it still isn't enough to do what they'd planned because of a lag in deposits or market ups and downs. The cost and terms of borrowing. Take into account how long you need the money for and/or how quickly you can pay it back. A higher interest rate may be tolerable if you won't be repaying it for long. This will also affect the total cost of the loan. Look at the interest rates of various loans and the total you will be paying back over time.

Starting and running a small business is a massive commitment of both money and time. Many people underestimate the time investment that it takes in the first few years of a business to get it off the ground, fully operational, and on track to success. In fact, time management tends to be one of the biggest issues for small-business owners. These tips can help you better manage your time and may even help you find the elusive work-life balance that drives many entrepreneurs to start businesses in the first place. 1. Use tech to work smarter and faster Many business owners love technology, and for a good reason  it can make your life easier. There are a limitless number of tech tools that can help you schedule business activities and automate processes. For instance, there's software that can help you track your hours so you can see how you're spending your time. (Slack, Asana, and Trello are some of the more popular choices.) If payroll takes you hours, you could consider looking at software that automates payroll (QuickBooks, Peachtree, Paychex, or similar). By getting smart\u201d about how you run your business, you can save enormous amounts of time and focus your energy on other duties or areas of your life. It can also help you find opportunities to delegate.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/4-skills-you-need-for-better-work-life-balance/"}
{"id": "0ab7a54949e5-1", "text": "Talk to your financial advisors about digital options for banking, tax returns, and related tasks. Be sure you know all the capabilities available with your current plans  and what else you could add. 2. Learn how to let go and delegate Delegating can be tough for business owners. Between money being too tight to justify a new hire, to fear of losing control\u201d of certain processes, many small-business owners fall into the trap of doing everything themselves. Start by documenting your process for the things you do each day (the technology you set up in step one may be able to help with this). Once you have these processes in place, think about which tasks you procrastinate about, which are time-consuming or which don't require decision making. When you've decided what to delegate, choose someone with the skill set and personality to suit those tasks. That may be someone on your team or a new hire. Taking the time to find a good match can make delegation (and training) much easier, and you will quickly see a return on your investment in the person you hire. Technology can help you outsource unpleasant or time-consuming tasks. Check out talent marketplace websites like UpWork or Fiverr and start posting opportunities there. 3. Put personal time on your calendar Setting aside uninterrupted time for your family and personal interests is crucial to striking a work-life balance and can make you more present when you do show up for work. For instance, you could make it a point to have nights with your partner or spend quality time with your kids, if you have them. Also, if volunteer work is important to you, make sure you set aside time for those non-business, community activities. Making time away from work can keep you fresh, too: Spend time on hobbies separate from your business, like gaming, home renovation, gardening, or whatever else you like. Time away from work can have the added benefit of helping with new ideas and creating a fresh perspective.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/4-skills-you-need-for-better-work-life-balance/"}

Just be sure to include the parts that make you happy, not just the challenges you face. Talking candidly about your business can help you realize which parts you enjoy and which you don't, which can help you delegate better. Spending all your energy on your business, 24/7/365, without recognizing the need for balance can easily lead to burnout in both your business and personal life. Time management, and finding the right balance between work and life, will be different for every business owner. But it's important that you find a strategy that works for you. Talk to kids in your family, too. Teach them about cash flow, financing, hiring and other key topics. That way, when they're ready to start working, they'll be one step ahead of their peers.

Here's what owners should know (and do) about it. A steady stream of cash is key to a successful business, but that's just one part of the entire financial picture. It's also important to maintain a strong liquidity ratio, which indicates the business is able to pay off its existing debts with its existing assets. The easier an asset is to access quickly, the more liquid it is. Cash is generally the most liquid asset because it's available at the touch of a few buttons on an ATM pad or a digital app  or sometimes in your wallet. The better a business's liquidity ratio, the more attractive it will be to lenders and investors, both of which can be extremely important for growth. While this may sound fairly simple, there are several ways to calculate a business's liquidity ratios. Understanding liquidity ratios One of the most common types of liquidity ratios used to determine a company's financial health is the current ratio. This compares all of the business's current assets to all of its current obligations. Sometimes, lenders and investors will also look at your quick ratio or your cash ratio. The former factors in only the business assets that can be accessed relatively quickly, and the latter focuses even more narrowly, comparing obligations to only cash and cash equivalents. To calculate your business's liquidity ratio, you'll be dividing the assets (current, quick, or cash) by business liabilities (debts/obligations). What the numbers mean Lenders and investors may use liquidity ratio calculations to determine how healthy your business is. They generally want to know that you have cash flow under control, you spend responsibly, and you pay off your debts. Here's what counts as healthy, high, or low.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/5-ways-to-improve-your-liquidity-ratio/"}
{"id": "4e3cab31a170-2", "text": "Healthy current ratio: A business with a healthy current ratio can typically meet its short-term demands and still have enough cash to invest or expand. Generally, a current ratio of 1.0 means that a company's liabilities do not exceed its liquid assets, though this can vary by industry. Numbers below 1.0 may be acceptable in industries where there's a quicker turnover in product and/or payment cycles are shorter. In this case, lenders may compare the business's liquidity score to the industry average to determine its status. High current ratio: This refers to a ratio higher than 1.0, and it occurs when a business holds on to too much cash that could be used or invested in other ways. Low current ratio: A ratio lower than 1.0 can result in a business having trouble paying short-term obligations. As such, it may make the business look like a bigger risk for lenders and investors.

One example: If your company has a paper trail, going digital can save you time and money that's now spent submitting and accepting paper checks. Sell unnecessary assets. Eliminating items such as surplus business equipment can provide a small sum of capital and reduce the average cost of equipment maintenance. Change your payment cycle. Talk to your vendors about opportunities for discounts if you pay early, which can save you hundreds to thousands of dollars. On the flip side, you can consider offering your customers discounts for submitting payments ahead of schedule. Look into a line of credit. A line of credit could help you cover gaps in cash flow due to payment schedules. Some business lines of credit offer access to up to $100,000 per year, with no annual fee for the first year. If you're considering this, compare terms before choosing a lender to work with. Revisit your debt obligations. If you have short-term debt, switching to long-term debt can require smaller monthly payments and give you more time to pay off the sum. On the flip side, switching long-term debt to short-term debt may mean higher monthly payments, but it can also mean that your debt will be paid off more quickly. Also consider options like debt consolidation and loan refinancing, which may help lower monthly payments now, while also saving you money in the long-term.

The best way for investors to know how you're going to treat their money is to look at how you treat your money. It's similar to the way a traditional mortgage lender looks at a credit report, an investor looks at a business's financial statements, including your balance sheet, which represents your assets, liabilities, and net worth in an easy-to-digest format. The structure of a balance sheet is built around a basic financial accounting equation: assets \u2013 liabilities = owner's equity Here's a breakdown of those terms as well as valuable tips, resources, and examples to help you create a snapshot of your business financials. Assets Assets include the value of everything owned by and owed to the business. On a balance sheet, assets are usually split into current and non-current assets. Current assets are cash and those items that are likely to become cash in one year or less, such as inventory, accounts receivable (amounts due in the short term), and notes receivable (amounts due within 12 months). Fixed assets, such as real estate and equipment, are categorized as non-current because they are less likely to sell in a year or less. For purposes of the balance sheet, assets will equal the sum of your current and non-current assets  less the depreciation (or decrease in value over time) of those assets.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/a-business-owners-guide-to-balance-sheets/"}
{"id": "0bc462363d30-1", "text": "Liabilities On the other side of the equation are your liabilities, both short- and long-term, which are the monetary obligations you owe to banks, creditors, and vendors. Short-term liabilities include accounts payable, such as monthly invoices owed to vendors and creditors, and notes payable owed to others within the next 12 months. Long-term liabilities, or those due more than a year away, include a mortgage balance payable beyond the current year. Owner's equity The last component of the balance sheet is owner's equity, sometimes referred to as net worth. This is your net investment in the company. It's equal to total assets minus total liabilities. The financial statement should balance, showing assets equaling liabilities plus owner's equity. Making balance sheets work for you While all balance sheets follow the same equation, the types of accounts listed will vary based on the type of business. Product-based companies, such as retailers, sell goods to consumers and have overhead expenses like inventory and real estate. Service-based companies, like dry cleaners or law firms, sell services instead of goods, so they do not typically have inventory or raw products on the balance sheet. The method and time period in which payment is accepted may also change what's listed in the balance sheet. Balance sheets are usually drafted at the end of accounting periods: monthly, quarterly, or yearly. It's a good idea to look at these documents alongside others such as income statements (which show long-term profits minus losses) and cash-flow statements (which show how quickly revenue is collected). A financial advisor can help you create and analyze these financial statements for a clear picture of your cash flow.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/a-business-owners-guide-to-balance-sheets/"}

There are a number of financing options developed specifically for small businesses. But traditional loans, lines of credit, and credit cards may not always be the best options. Plus, newer businesses may not qualify, since you generally need to be in business for a set period of time in order to do so. The good news is, there are various financing options available to new and existing businesses. Here are five. 1. Seller financing If you're buying a big-ticket item for your business, the seller may offer financing. This is most common with vehicles, real estate, and large equipment. You may be able to take advantage of sales incentives, such as 0% interest for a specified period or lower sticker prices. 2.

Depending on the platform you use, this money may be offered as a grant, a loan, or somewhere in between (e.g., you may need to send investors a free product sample but not repay the funds). It's interesting to note that while women are much less likely to receive venture funds from investors, they're more successful when it comes to crowdfunding (a 70 percent success rate compared to men's 61 percent). 4.

November 2022 Once an application is submitted, depending on the type of credit, it will go through several stages of review. A business credit application goes through various steps to evaluate and ensure a fair and thorough review. A single application can be seen by lenders, underwriters, and analysts  or it can go through a quick automated process, depending on the size and type of credit requested. In all cases, it is vital to provide accurate and up-to-date information on the application. This will help it move through the process as quickly as possible. As you await a reply, you may be interested to know what's happening behind the scenes. These are some of the stages that your application may go through before you hear back from the lender. 1. Initial verification The first group to handle the loan application will check the facts. This group will ensure that the information on the application is accurate and that the lender has all the necessary data to make a decision. Some of the things they will verify are: Income and expenses Time in business and/or age of business (if purchased form a previous owner) Personal and business credit reports Ownership records", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/applying-for-business-credit-what-happens-after-i-apply/"}

For example, lenders may review such things as checking and savings accounts, the date those accounts were opened, and the 12-month average balances, as well as credit card account balances and payments. 2. Scoring Once all the data from the application is verified, the lender will give the business a score to determine its creditworthiness. Some factors that come into play include cash flow, expenses, debt, the age of the business, and what collateral is available. It's important to keep in mind the numbers often vary from lender to lender. Some lenders use the FICO\u00ae Score model (for real estate loans, for example), while others use the FICO\u00ae Auto Score (for vehicle loans) or the FICO\u00ae Bankcard Score (for credit cards). They will also look at personal and business scores.

However, the pandemic has impacted many businesses in different ways  including some healthcare practices, which saw drops in patient visits  so that may impact scores, too. Learn more at Understanding Credit Scores. 3. Underwriting Scoring is more or less automatic  and may result in an automatic approval  but in some cases, the decision to approve a loan may shift to the underwriter. It is the underwriter's job to take a much more detailed and nuanced view of the numbers and make the ultimate decision whether the level of risk to the lender is acceptable. The underwriter can decide whether a factor indicating higher risk (such as few years in business) is offset by other strengths (such as experience launching previous businesses", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/applying-for-business-credit-what-happens-after-i-apply/"}

Be sure you clearly understand the terms of the loan and create a clear plan for staying on track with payments.

Yet, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that many minority-owned businesses, especially those owned by solopreneurs, have little time to devote to these efforts.

Here's why it's worth making online upgrades part of your business plan this year  and how to find help easing into it. Get excited If you've made it this far, you may be wondering why you should bother building an online presence. It's simple: Customers and prospects today are increasingly searching for businesses online. More than half of consumers today (64%) have been using a mix of online and in-person shopping for the past 6 months, per the Bazaarvoice 2022 Shopper Experience Index. And that trend is likely to continue. PwC predicts that e-commerce is expected to make up 95% of sales by 2040. Also consider this: In recent years, nearly one-third of global consumers have begun prioritizing purchases from minority-owned businesses  especially younger generations that are also known for being digital-savvy.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/boost-your-online-presence/"}
{"id": "a5e307b71b8f-1", "text": "Get verified You can start to build an online presence without investing time and money into building a website (though you may want to do that later). Many people use crowd-sourced reviews on various websites to find information about businesses, so these third-party platforms are a great way to start building a digital footprint for your company. You can register your business with review sites like Yelp and search engines like Google. (Creating a Google Business profile only takes a few minutes, though you'll be asked to verify by mail that you're the business owner. This helps protect your business but can take a few weeks.) These and other online shopping and review sites are also giving businesses a way to identify as minority-owned. For example, Google Merchant Center provides an option to identify your business as Black-owned, Latino-owned, veteran-owned, or women-owned. Google Digital Coaches also provide free training and coaching to help Black and Latinx small businesses create a thriving online presence. It may be worth your while to research what your favorite shopping sites are offering to help minority-owned businesses. Not only do consumers use these sites to discover companies, the sites themselves often provide metrics about how many people searched for your business and what percentage engaged to find out more. Action tip: Boost your relevance once you've registered your business or created a profile by asking customers to post reviews.

Diversity in business can be a game-changer. While it's often discussed in the context of Fortune 500 companies, small businesses can reap the many benefits as well. When you build relationships  internally, as well as with partners and vendors  that reflect a variety of backgrounds and perspectives, it can lead to innovation and growth, as well as a deeper connection with your customers. What is diversity? We traditionally think of diversity as a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds, including different genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, and more. In business, diversity can also refer to diversity of thought or experience, like living abroad or having worked in a different field. What are the benefits? Working with a diverse group of people, from your suppliers to your staff, can provide inspiration. When you bring together unique and different perspectives, the conversations and ideas tend to be more nuanced, richer, and more representative. This may ultimately lead to a better business, from operations and products to the customers you attract. At larger corporations, diversity is often linked directly to innovation and revenue driven by innovation. You can apply this same thinking to your business. In fact, a diverse staff may be able to better connect with your current customers or help you win new customers. If someone on your team shares an ethnicity with a potential client, they're more likely to understand that client and help you win that business. How can I build a more diverse team?", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/building-diversity-into-your-small-business/"}
{"id": "dad1a2d60b5b-1", "text": "How can I build a more diverse team? If you have few (or no) employees, you can still reap the benefits of a diverse network. Apply the same thinking to your suppliers, partners, contractors, and so on. To build a diverse team, first evaluate what voices and perspectives may be missing. For instance, if you notice a large number of your clients are Latinx, and you don't have any Latinx employees or consultants, you could be missing an opportunity. Next, reach outside your network when hiring or sourcing. We often hire from within our immediate circle or based on referrals from our close contacts, and this can narrow our reach. Instead, post jobs on message boards and websites aimed at broadening your pool. As businesses across industries struggle with historic levels of staff shortages, searching in new places for candidates can be another way to attract the talent you need. Action tip: Try to incorporate diversity beyond your immediate team; actively seek out diverse suppliers and vendors. In addition to diversity on your team (and with your partners), think about how you attract diverse customers. Do your marketing materials show people of all races and genders? Do you make sure all of your customers are treated respectfully, regardless of background, income level, or age? These may seem like small or obvious steps, but they add up and make a big difference to how your company is perceived. How can I foster innovation? It's not enough to hire people with diverse perspectives. In order to build a diverse workplace  and harness the innovation that it can create  you need to make sure your team and network feel supported.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/building-diversity-into-your-small-business/"}
{"id": "dad1a2d60b5b-2", "text": "To build a culture that fosters collaboration and creativity, consider who you consult on important decisions and how you react to ideas from team members. For instance, it's normal to value the opinions of trusted advisors more highly. But what might this preference look like to another, newer team member? Might it appear that you're discounting the opinions of others? Action tip: Seek out ideas that might challenge your point of view as the business owner. It may mean asking suppliers, advisors, and even customers for feedback. Even if you don't change your mind, your original idea may become stronger in the process. Develop a system that allows people (employees, consultants, partners, or anyone else you work with) to share open and honest feedback. A more formal process can make it easier for team members to share concerns or suggestions than a face-to-face conversation. Making it a system means fostering diverse opinions that will become part of your workplace culture as you grow your business. While prioritizing diversity, it's also important to ensure that your workplace environment  physically and culturally  is welcoming to all. For example, if you are bringing on a new hire who uses a wheelchair, make sure the office is set up so that person has the same access as all other staff. Action tip: Avoid putting people on the spot about their unique experience. Focus on making people comfortable enough to share, versus requiring they do so. Building a diverse network and team can lead to direct business outcomes, but it's about more than business. Fostering diversity should be done thoughtfully. Focus on creating an inclusive business that represents a variety of individuals and ideas. Empathy and innovation could very well go hand in hand.

And while Black-, Asian-, and Hispanic-owned businesses were as likely as white-owned businesses to apply for credit in 2020, they were much less likely to receive the funding they sought: 58% of white-owned businesses said they received all of the credit they requested, compared to just 36% of Black-owned businesses and 35% of Asian-owned businesses.1 Small business owners This inequity means that if you're a minority business owner, you're more likely to turn to higher-risk options to meet your funding needs. Higher-risk options tend to cost more, come with a shorter repayment term, and increase a borrower's risk of late payments and default. Regardless of what type of financing you are able to obtain, it's important to understand the level of risk you are taking on. Consider the following financing options and their relative levels of risk. Lower risk Lower-risk financing options offer predictability and thorough underwriting processes to help ensure your business is in a good position to repay them. Traditional business loans Provided by banks and other financial institutions, traditional business loans typically have fixed interest rates, which means business owners can anticipate exactly how much they'll need to pay over the life of the loan. The terms on a business loan depend on your credit, business finances, time in business, type of business, and other factors.2", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/business-financing-options-for-small-business/"}
{"id": "1cd5f94e4202-1", "text": "Business lines of credit A business line of credit is similar to a traditional loan, except that it provides an ongoing and reusable option to access capital up to a certain cap. Lines of credit lower risk by allowing you to borrow only what you need at any given time, reducing the amount you have to pay back over time. However, be aware that lines of credit often have variable interest rates, which rise and fall along with prevailing rates. In a rising rate environment, your loan will grow more expensive over time. SBA Loans The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers a series of loan programs that are administered by partner lenders throughout the country, often targeting borrowers who are not well served by the traditional lending industry. SBA loans are among the lowest-risk borrowing options, as they come with low rates and may be accompanied by support, such as business advice or financial management help. Moderate risk These options come with higher interest rates or other features that make them somewhat more risky for borrowers. Short-term business loans These bank loans are structured as typical installment loans, but on a short timeframe  usually three to 10 years. Short-term business loans often have higher interest rates than longer-term loans, which can make them more difficult to repay successfully. Invoice factoring Like a merchant cash advance, invoice factoring allows a lender to use revenue you haven't yet collected as collateral for a loan. However, invoice factoring, which is most often available via alternative online lenders, is somewhat less risky than a merchant cash advance. That's because the invoices are specific expected payments that can be collected upon. Invoice factoring can be a reasonable option for businesses with certain cash flow needs, such as slow payment from certain customers or seasonal ups and downs.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/business-financing-options-for-small-business/"}
{"id": "1cd5f94e4202-2", "text": "Venture capital (VC) Venture capital investors generally do not require personal assets as collateral. Likewise, venture capitalists (VCs) typically don't expect business owners to pay back their investments on a particular time schedule. Instead, VCs seek equity in the company and also may assume a decision-making role  potentially taking more ownership and decision-making power than the founder is comfortable giving up. Higher risk These options put your personal credit at risk, and some carry high interest rates. Personal loans Using personal loans from a bank or credit union to fund a business is very risky: Inability to pay back a personal loan will damage your personal credit. If you must give a personal guarantee or put up collateral of a personal nature  for instance, you might take out a home equity loan or line of credit using your home as collateral  those assets can be foreclosed on if the business defaults. Merchant cash advances These loans, offered by alternative lenders that often operate online, treat your business's future revenues as an asset to lend against. Advances are high risk because you are borrowing against money you don't yet have; if you don't bring in the predicted amount of revenue, you will be at risk of defaulting on the loan. Since these loans are considered high risk, they often have high interest rates and rigid repayment terms. Personal credit cards Credit cards often come with high interest rates, which can make repayment increasingly difficult over time. Using personal credit cards for business purposes  a common tactic for many small business owners, especially early in the life of the business  puts your personal credit at risk. Borrow confidently Like many small business owners, you may be reluctant to take on debt. But with a better understanding of your options and how each could help your business grow, you can feel more confident in assessing the capital you need to reach your goals.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/business-financing-options-for-small-business/"}

This challenge can prove especially difficult for entrepreneurs from underrepresented communities. Lenders often evaluate loan applications based on hard numbers: your company's cash-flow statements and balance sheet, your personal income, debts, credit scores, and the like. But because of wealth disparities, some entrepreneurs start out with less liquid capital than others. Black and Hispanic households in the U.S. have, on average, about 15% to 20% as much net wealth as their white peers.1 But don't let how much money you have, or don't have, in your bank account keep you from applying. Lenders also consider other vital information, from your business plan and career background to compelling research on your customers. Here are four tips to help small business owners frame that information and provide additional details to strengthen a loan application. Our accompanying worksheet(link opens in a new tab) will help ensure you're well organized to help improve your chance of securing the cash your company needs.

{"id": "0d36f2259153-1", "text": "Use big-picture sections like the executive summary to sell your vision for your business. Tell the story of why you launched it and what market gaps or societal needs it answers, especially if you serve an underrepresented customer base. Back all of that up with industry research that demonstrates your business case, laying out the size of the target market, customer base, and growth potential. Next, dive into the financials. Lay out every detail you can in current income statements and balance sheets, as well as cash-flow and income projections. You'll build an impressive, realistic financial road map showing exactly where your company is now and where you intend to take it. 2. Describe how you plan to use the loan  and pay it back Another great tactic is to put yourself in the lender's shoes. Prepare detailed answers for everything they might ask about how their financial assistance will help your business succeed. Provide details about how you plan to use the capital. You may be looking to buy new equipment, for example, or move your company to a more profitable location.2 Also be ready to describe how you plan to pay the money back. Depending on the length of your loan, prepare a yearly projection plan that lays out details on projected sales and a payment plan for each year. Provide a list of key customers, as well as customer demographics and any advantages you may have in catering to your customers. The more sharply you can bring your clients into focus, the more assurance the lender will have that you know your market and will use their money well.3 Consider collateral, too. If you're applying for a loan that requires it, map out every asset you have to help secure the loan.2 If you don't have that kind of capital, there are other options. The Small Business Administration's SBA 7(a) loans don't require collateral for loans up to $25,000.

Use a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to show, through concrete examples, that you have the experience to run a thriving business and manage the loan well. While these details may not directly affect a lender's decision on your loan, they can help you build relationships with your banker. It can also help to include a personal background document that walks lenders through any other basics they might want to know: addresses where you've lived, degrees and qualifications you've earned, and name changes, for example. If you have one, be equally thorough about your team. Highlight individual strengths and any special expertise that gives your business a competitive advantage. You're introducing the lender to more people they can trust. 4. Telling your story builds trust and confidence The more supplemental details you provide to potential lenders, the better. In addition to showing that you're honest and thorough about your financial position, they also give you the chance to put those numbers in valuable context and start a dialogue with lenders about your company. Preparing that information will also hone your sense of what loan type and amount works best for you. Rejection is always possible, but it doesn't mean the end of the road. If a lender declines your application, ask if they'll share why or need additional information from you. You can also look for alternatives to traditional loans, such as crowdfunding and community-focused grants. For example, some businesses serving local communities are eligible for loans through a federal program called the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. Financial details will always be a primary factor in a loan application.

When you work for yourself, you likely don't have managers or colleagues who can sing your praises or introduce you to a room of new people. That means networking is even more important to get you in front of potential partners, advisors, and connections. We have realized because of the pandemic that we are so interconnected.

Here are four networking strategies beyond mix-and mingle events that can help expand your network in ways that feel more authentic.\n.

Rekindle professional relationships It's easy to underestimate the connections we already have, but don't forget to tap into these relationships. You may have past mentors, clients, instructors, or other informal supporters who can help you take your business to the next level. Also consider connections you've made at past networking events, but with whom you didn't get to follow up. To reconnect, reach out via email, phone, or direct message through platforms such as LinkedIn. These supporters can lead you to new business opportunities, giving you valuable insights and simply providing listening ears when you need support. Get intentional about sustaining these relationships: Set calendar reminders to follow up every month or quarter. 3. Lean into online communities There are a multitude of interest- and industry-based social media groups where diverse small business owners share resources and advice on how to deal with challenges. Search for relevant groups on Facebook and LinkedIn, as well as Reddit forums. For example, group discussions may include how owners in your industry are dealing with inflation when purchasing supplies or what they're doing to combat higher interest rates. These informal online interactions may feel less invasive than traditional in-person networking. Post and answer questions in these groups. If you see someone you want to connect with further, ask to send them a direct message or schedule a virtual lunch. Use your social media channels to engage with people and companies you admire or want to work with.

Even businesses with healthy growth and strong sales run the risk of owing more than they can pay in a given month. Fortunately, spending less than an hour each month on a cash flow projection can help you identify potential cash shortfalls in the months ahead. Before you create a cash flow projection for your business, it's important to identify your key assumptions about how cash flows in and out of your business each month. Identifying some key assumptions Key assumptions should relate to two primary areas: Receivables: These assumptions should outline how quickly you receive payment from your customers. For example, if most of your customers pay you within 30 days, a key assumption could be: 90% of sales will be collected the month after the sale. Payables: These assumptions should outline when your payments are due. For example, if your vendors require payment within 2 weeks of delivery, a key assumption could be: Payables are due within 14 days of purchase. Don't let optimism factor into your key assumptions. Only the most likely numbers should appear on your spreadsheet. Drafting your cash flow projection With these realistic assumptions in hand, you can begin drafting your cash flow projection. To get started, create 12 columns across the top of a spreadsheet, representing the next 12 months. Then, in another column on the left-hand side, list the following cash flow categories and enter the appropriate amount in each column for each month (see descriptions below):", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/creating-a-cash-flow-projection/"}

A 5% variance one way or the other can be okay, but if it starts being more than 5%, you should revisit your key assumptions to check for flaws in your logic. Even if your actual numbers come in higher than your projections, you should take a close look at your assumptions, because higher returns in the short term could lead to shortfalls later on. To make sure your projection stays accurate throughout the year, be sure to consider these variable expenses.

If you add a new month to the end every time a month is completed, you'll always have a long-term grasp of your business's financial health. However, don't try to project more than 12 months into the future. If you look too far into the future: One, it may take a lot of your time. Two, many variables can change. Prime rates could go up, for example. If possible, delegate projection updates to a bookkeeper or accountant. Beyond saving you time, this allows you to take a higher-level view of the projection and will help you identify errors more easily.

But they can do much more than that. Regularly generating a (P&L) statement is an effective way to track your business's financial health. It helps you easily see whether you're becoming more profitable or losing funds. Here, we'll explore the key components of a P&L statement for small business and give you an example to reference as you create your own statement. What is a P&L statement? A P&L showcases a company's income and expenses over a certain time period. Typically, a business makes a P&L statement quarterly or annually  but they also can be done more frequently. Consider reviewing a few recent statements together to look for trends. This can be particularly helpful if you're weighing any big financial decisions. Detailed P&L records can also help when it comes time to file tax returns for your business.

But it's important to understand what goes into them as if you were running the numbers yourself. There are two main parts of a P&L report: income and expenses. However, the order in which things are calculated is designed to give you a better understanding of your business and operations. 1. Sales The first thing reported on a P&L statement is the business's revenue from sales. Other forms of income  such as investment income  are factored in later. 2. Cost of goods sold (COGS) Next, businesses that sell goods must figure the cost of the goods they've sold. This should include any materials, transportation, or production-related expenses that your business pays before you can sell a product. 3. Gross profit Subtract COGS from your sales to determine gross profit over the given timeframe. For example, if the COGS for one of your products is $10 and you", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/creating-a-profit-and-loss-statement/"}

Your gross profit can give you a sense of your core business before factoring in overhead and other costs. 4. Other income This section includes any income the business may have earned outside of day-to-day activity, such as income from interest, dividends, rents, gains from the sale of capital assets, etc. 5. Expenses Expenses are next. These are expenses tied to running your business, and not those tied to the creation of specific products (which were covered in COGS). This is where you'll see payroll, office supplies, payments to lawyers or accountants, interest paid on any loans, advertising costs, and more. One thing to keep in mind: If you are purchasing an asset (equipment, a computer, a car, etc.), it's considered a capital expenditure, and the accounting is different than more basic expenses. 6. Net profit or loss Take your gross profits and add any extra", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/creating-a-profit-and-loss-statement/"}

This gives you your net income  a positive net income is a profit; a negative net income is a loss. Even businesses that have high gross profits can post losses if their expenses get out of hand. And this is the type of thing you can look for when you reference your P&L on a regular basis. 7. P&L example Consider a small pizza restaurant with $100,000 in yearly sales. The restaurant's COGS includes ingredients and packaging and comes to $7,000. (Since the restaurant's staff is on payroll, they get paid regardless of the number of pizzas sold. That means labor wouldn't factor into COGS; it will be factored in later as a payroll expense.) The pizza shop owns their building and collects rent from a tenant, which supplies $5,000 in additional income. Sales ($100,000) minus COGS ($7,000) equals gross profit of $93,000. Gross profit plus additional income ($5,000) equals total", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/creating-a-profit-and-loss-statement/"}

Gross profit ($98,000) less total expenses ($73,000) equals a net profit of $25,000. This example is meant to be illustrative, and for a new business, a profit margin of 25% is considered high. (Turn this into a percent by dividing your net profit by your gross profit and multiplying by 100.) Plus, some industries have higher profit margins by nature. Look up what an average profit margin is for your industry and use the P&L reports you're running to understand how you stack up. If your profit margins are higher than your industry, see if you can maintain that margin as you grow.

A recent study conducted by the U.S. Small Business Administration found that the majority of small business owners feel their business may be vulnerable to a cyberattack. Yet many do not take action because they feel they don't have the time or financial resources to invest in cybersecurity  or they simply don't know where to begin. Here's the thing: You might not be able to afford the security infrastructure of a large corporation but there are basic security principles that any business can follow, no matter its size. The Federal Trade Commission offers tips and tools to help enhance your small business security. Keep in mind, Wells Fargo is watching out for you by consistently enhancing our security measures and identifying new and emerging threats to help keep your accounts and information secure. In addition, you can help yourself by taking steps to further enhance your security. Your first step: Developing a cybersecurity plan. Creating a thorough plan is worth the effort, as it will help prioritize your next steps and determine what your business really needs. Here's how to start: Identify your assets and potential threats Create a document that lists all your physical technology assets, such as computers and servers, and catalog who has access to each. Create a separate list of digital assets, such as customer records and intellectual property, and note where that information is stored. Note any cloud-based systems you use  any software or data you access via the internet vs. a local computer drive. Once these documents are complete, use them to identify your most important assets and list potential threats to each. As you develop your cybersecurity plan, ensure that these threats are addressed.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/cybersecurity-planning-for-any-small-business/"}

Review vendor practices at least annually to ensure continued compliance with industry standards. Make sure your service agreements with your technology vendors address any security concerns  cybersecurity needs to be built into any agreement. Check that your SaaS providers are protecting sensitive customer data such as credit card details or other personal information and are compliant with relevant data privacy laws such as GLBA, GDPR, and HIPPA.. Make sure your financial institution's approach to cybersecurity fits your own: look for multifactor authentication, strong encryption practices, and continuous monitoring of all account activity. Set minimum security requirements for your suppliers and develop defense with Assume Breach\u201d in mind.

Passwords should be a minimum of 12 characters (the longer the better) and use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Use strong authentication measures. Explore the possibility of using two-factor authentication and single sign-on (which unifies login information with the various third-party software portals your company may use) to lessen the odds and impact of a compromised account. To investigate these options, you can download a free authentication generator or purchase a package from a trusted security provider. Devise a tiered system for assigning administrative rights to users, so that not all employees have access to all information. Also be sure to revoke access when an employee leaves the company or when a contractor's work is complete. Train employees and contractors to recognize and avoid security risks and report suspicious activity. For example, ransomware attacks often succeed when an employee opens a malicious file on a work device through a personal email account or USB device.

Explore whether your business may be able to protect and isolate sensitive data within your network using multilayered encryption. Approaches to encryption vary in complexity from business to business, so consider which elements make most sense for your business to encrypt. To help protect yourself, ensure all devices on your network are running the latest software. Enable automatic updates and patches to your software to help protect against viruses, malware, and threats. Frequently back up local data to the cloud and other local storage to preserve data in case of an attack. Consider a trial run of any new solutions so you can fully assess if a product will suit your needs. Use encryption on Wi-Fi routers and provide separate networks for guest access.

Also make sure the plan includes service level agreements and current contact information so you're not scrambling in the middle of a crisis. Make sure the plan is available and easily accessible.

If your application for business credit was turned down, use it as an opportunity to understand why and learn how you may be able to improve your credit profile before you apply again. 1. Determine why the credit request was denied There are lots of reasons a lender might be unwilling to extend credit. They can include: Insufficient credit history No proven ability to pay off a loan Derogatory items on a credit report such as late charges, a lien or a bankruptcy Lack of collateral to secure a loan When a loan or other credit type is denied, you can ask the lender to share the reasons for denial in writing. Understanding why credit was denied can help you better use the various resources available to help. The National Foundation on Credit Counseling offers services specifically for small business owners. 2. Understand what lenders look for While a personal credit score might be a key factor, lenders also focus on other factors related to your business's financial performance. In other words: your business's track record matters. When reviewing an application, a lender will consider: Is the business viable in the short and long term? Are the owners making payments on time? Do they maintain a stable, positive cash flow and/or cash reserves that can support current and future payment obligations?

If you're currently seeking credit for your business, you're not alone. 43% of firms applied for new financing in 2019.1 To give yourself a better chance of getting approved for financing, it's important to develop a strong credit application. Here are four things to consider when preparing your application: 1. Credit purpose When you apply for credit, the financial institution will want to know how you plan to use the money you borrow. Whether it's for equipment or inventory, you should have a clear understanding of why you need credit. In addition, make sure your credit request is practical. If you ask for more money than your business can realistically repay, the lender may deny your loan request or make a counteroffer for a lower amount. 2. Credit history Before making a credit decision, the lender will pull reports to review your personal and business credit history to find out if you have a history of making timely payments to your creditors and how much debt you have. Recent credit inquiries and interest-only mortgages may also affect a lender's credit decision. This information will help lenders determine whether you are a responsible borrower. If you have a weaker personal or business credit report, take steps to improve it. For example, you may want to accelerate paying down your existing credit or set up automatic payments to reduce your risk of late payments. 3. Company finances Your company's cash flow also plays a key role in your ability to get approved for credit. Lenders will look at how much revenue your business generates to ensure you can repay any additional debt. A lender may also request collateral \u2013 that could come in many forms such as business equipment or real estate.

In this ever-evolving digital world, it continues to be beneficial and essential for small and mid-sized businesses to ensure their leading marketing, sales, and payment methods match the preferences of consumers. According to the 2021 EY Future Consumer Index, 43 percent of consumers say they will do more online shopping than they did before the COVID-19 pandemic. But a Digital.com survey found that about a quarter of small retail businesses don't even have a website. If that disconnect sounds familiar, it may be time to examine opportunities to improve your company's digital marketing, digital payment acceptance (which can account for anything from credit and debit cards to mobile wallet), and loyalty program strategies. But don't wait too long  you don't want your competitors to get ahead of you on the digital learning curve. A new survey by Ripl, Inc., found that half of small businesses are already participating in paid digital advertising, and most of them plan to maintain or even increase their efforts. Here are three business opportunities to help you hone your digital strategy and improve customer relationships.\n.

A thorough website renovation, including updating policies and products, adding personality and branding, taking down dated or broken pages, and adding more photos of you and your friendly team. Whether it makes the most sense to outsource these tasks to a vendor or work them into daily responsibilities will depend on a business's resources and capabilities. Conduct a thorough review of your current approach to marketing to begin assessing how digital improvements may fit into your strategy. 2. Lower-cost payment processing Cash flow is the lifeblood of your business, but manually handling, processing, and dealing with cash, checks, and money orders can be costly and time-consuming. What's more, ShopifyPlus reported on a 41 percent increase in the number of real-time transactions from 2019 to 2020. By 2025, these digital instant payments are expected to make up nearly 20 percent of transactions. Meanwhile, a study by Blackhawk Network Global Digital Payments found that 54 percent of consumers surveyed will spend more money at a retailer where digital payments are allowed. To smooth the transition to accepting payments via mobile phones and wearable devices, consider investing in new payment systems. Also consider setting up recurring digital payments to your suppliers, vendors, utilities, and others, which is also a time-saver.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/digital-upgrades-that-can-strengthen-your-business-growth/"}

Mutually rewarding loyalty programs Loyalty programs have been found to strengthen bonds with existing customers and positively impact visit and sales figures: Recent research from Clarus Commerce shows that 87 percent of consumers who like a company's loyalty program will choose that company over a competitor with lower prices. Since the vast majority of consumers prefer rewards apps over punch cards, this is a great place to digitize. While loyalty programs do tend to require some maintenance, their advantages can make the effort worthwhile. Consider the following tips and tricks to help boost such a program's impact: Keep it simple. Put few limitations on program-eligible purchases and make the path to rewards short and clearly defined  especially for the first reward. Make it valuable. A free item or discount reward should be worth working toward. Not sure what would be most motivating? Ask a few prospects or customers. Spread the word. Commit to promoting the benefits via digital marketing channels and encourage program members to do the same. As the digital marketplace increasingly becomes the norm, it's worth taking into account the potential benefits of online enhancements such as digital marketing, digital payments, and loyalty programs, and finding tangible steps for implementing these strategies.

Automated Clearing House (ACH) can help you digitize payroll and vendor payments, saving time and resources. What is ACH? ACH is a type of electronic payment that transfers funds between U.S. bank accounts through a network of financial institutions. Established in the 1970s, the ACH network enables you to digitally move funds between your own bank account and a vendor or employee bank account. Trillions of dollars route through ACH each year, including PayPal, Venmo, and Zelle\u00ae1 transactions. In fact, 2022 was a record year2 with more than 30 billion ACH payments, which averages about 90 payments per U.S. citizen. How does ACH work? There are two types of ACH payments: credit and debit. ACH credit With an ACH credit, also known as a direct deposit, you push\u201d funds from your bank account into an employee's or vendor's bank account. The payer initiates the transaction. It takes three steps: Step 1: Obtain the vendor or employee's name, bank name, account type, account number, and bank routing number. Step 2: Submit payment details through Wells Fargo Business Online\u00ae or Commercial Electronic Office\u00ae (CEO\u00ae) ACH that includes the account information and payment amount. Step 3: The funds are transferred from your account on the designated date.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/digitize-the-payment-process-with-ach/"}
{"id": "59cacc8ee750-1", "text": "For recurring payments, such as payroll, rent, or mortgage, you can set up automated ACH credits. ACH debit For an ACH debit, also known as a direct payment, money is pulled\u201d from one account to another. With the payer's permission, the recipient initiates the transaction to withdraw funds from the payer's account. The payer provides the recipient the same banking information as listed in Step 1 above. The recipient submits the payment file to their bank and pulls funds from your bank account. For example, you might set up automated ACH debit for your utility bills, which arrive monthly but vary in cost each month. How can I use ACH? In 2022, there were more than 8 billion direct deposit ACH payments overall. One of the more familiar uses for ACH is for direct deposit of payroll3. But ACH has other useful applications for small businesses, too. For example, you can use ACH for: Employee payments, such as reimbursed travel expenses or 401(k) contributions. Vendor payments, including those for suppliers, rent, or utilities. Government payments, such as tax payments and refunds, Social Security payments, and stimulus payments. Investment dividend and interest payments, including monthly payments. What are potential advantages of ACH? There are several advantages for your small business in using ACH payments.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/digitize-the-payment-process-with-ach/"}
{"id": "59cacc8ee750-2", "text": "Cost savings: ACH payments are less expensive compared to paper checks, credit card transactions, and wire transfers. Convenience: You will no longer need to take time printing, signing, and mailing paper checks, and making runs to the post office or bank. You can make ACH transactions from your office or while working remotely at home. The automated process makes it easy to schedule recurring payments, so there's no need to set a calendar reminder or keep track of paper invoices for these standard charges. Faster processing times: ACH payments can process as quickly as the same day or up to three days. That fast turnaround can help with your cash flow and let you know sooner if a payment from a vendor is declined. Security: ACH payments eliminate the need to mail paper checks, which are vulnerable to fraud. Your personal and account data are encrypted with each ACH transaction, for your protection. If there are any ACH errors, there are rules and regulations in place to help protect you. Consistency: By scheduling recurring ACH payments, you're creating a more consistent cash flow that's easier to forecast. How do I get started making this type of transaction? It's easy to establish ACH payments for your small business. Talk to your banker today to find out how to set up ACH payments.

May 2023 The best method for getting your product to consumers can change over time. To efficiently move your products to customers, choosing the right distribution strategy is essential. The first step is understanding the key difference between direct and indirect distribution: Direct distribution means you take responsibility for delivering your goods into the hands of consumers. Many small business owners who are just launching their business use this method. Indirect distribution means enlisting a distributor to get your products to a retailer, who can sell on your behalf. As your business grows, this option may be more efficient and effective. What's right for your business? Compare the options: Pros and cons of direct distribution Whether it's done by a small business or a multinational company, direct distribution allows products to be sold directly to customers. On a micro scale, a jewelry maker selling small collections may choose to set up a website and sell directly to the public. On a larger scale, Apple sells directly to consumers through their Apple online store. Keep in mind that while direct distribution may offer advantages, there are also potential pitfalls when not using middlemen. Pros: You have total control over how the product is marketed and sold, and there is no fighting with competitors for shelf space at retailers. Cons: Going it alone may be more time-consuming and expensive for some business owners, and you may have more limited market coverage.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/direct-vs-indirect-distribution-channels-whats-best-for-you/"}
{"id": "440164494d6c-1", "text": "Pros and cons of indirect distribution With indirect distribution, your small business sells wholesale to agents or retailers so that they can distribute the product for you. They store it, display it, and employ a sales force to market the product and ultimately get it into the hands of customers. As with direct distribution, though, there are positives and negatives. Pros: Distribution agents specialize in getting products into as many markets as possible, and retailers know their local markets and how best to sell your product there. Cons: Distribution agents and retailers will share in your profits, and retailers may sell your competitors' products alongside yours.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/direct-vs-indirect-distribution-channels-whats-best-for-you/"}
{"id": "440164494d6c-2", "text": "Choosing a distribution strategy Determining the best method for getting your product to the consumer depends on what you're selling and how much you're willing to invest in distribution. In many cases, businesses use a blend of direct and indirect distribution methods that matches their needs and strategy. New small businesses generally don't have the capital to pursue multiple distribution avenues at the outset, so they need to choose one that fits, and stick with it while the business grows. Generally, if your product is perishable or if you're selling B2B, it's helpful to have fewer distribution channels between your point of manufacturing and your customer. In such cases, direct distribution may be best. If, however, you're aiming for a wider market with hopes of getting your products in front of as many consumers as possible, you may need to sell to distributors and let them handle this side of the business while you focus on making the product better or expanding your product line. If you do partner with distributors, do some vetting to ensure that you are working with a company that can serve your needs. The goal is to develop a long-lasting relationship. You're the product expert, but you're leveraging their sales expertise. Whatever your distribution strategy, it's smart to stay flexible and adjust your approach as your business changes.

Small businesses are the backbone of the economy, making up nearly half of the workforce in the private sector. Within that, diverse businesses are among the fastest growing segment. Yet, despite their importance to the economy diverse small businesses have historically faced numerous systemic challenges that have created obstacles to their success. Then the pandemic added to these challenges, disproportionately impacting diverse owners who two years on continue to struggle against inflation, labor shortages, and supply chain disruption. Supporting small businesses is crucially important to Wells Fargo in understanding the challenges they face and the support they need is the first step to providing that support. Digging into these topics today is our esteemed panel from the Pan Asian American, Black, and Hispanic Chambers of Commerce. First, we have Susan Allen.

Yet so many of these owners face significant challenges. So, Mr. Cavasos, why is representation important to Hispanic businesses? Why does that matter?

Ms. Allen, in the past, you've talked about lack of representation, and how this is a significant obstacle to Asian American business owners. Now, the question is how does this negatively affect businesses? Why is representation so important to you? I think representation in the United States Congress, where policies and laws are made that affect our daily lives is extremely important. Take a look at the last two years when COVID-19 blanketed the country with fear, economic and health devastation, and Asian Americans suffered an additional problem, anti-Asian discrimination and violence. We lost lives and property, and so much more. Two thirds of the crimes were perpetrated at places of business owned by Asian Americans.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}

Do me a favor. Can you tell us how some of the unique ways that are in place right now that affect Black businesses that might be different? Well, great question, Reggie. So often Black business issues get painted under the broad brush of minority programs. And what we asked for last year were three particular specific issues. One was intentionality. We wanted to be able to understand what was happening in the Black business community, versus that of minority programs. We have seen historically that it has been white women that have benefited from minority programs. About 78% of all of the federal government contracts were awarded to white women, versus those of Black business owners only received 1.67% of all of the federal government contracts. We're asking for three things, intentionality, transparency, and then thirdly, accountability. Diverse businesses were more", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-6", "text": "then thirdly, accountability. Diverse businesses were more likely, compared to majority of white owned businesses, to experience financial and or operational challenges during the pandemic. Mr. Cavasos, why were Hispanic small diverse business owners especially challenged when it came to accessing funds, and what did you learn from that experience? Well, Reggie, there are 5 million Latino-owned businesses in America. Only 52% of those 5 million businesses had a banking relationship prior to COVID. And even before COVID they were challenged to get approval for lending, or more access to capital. A big part of the challenges of these small businesses once COVID hit was the fact that they have a lot of information. They needed more capacity to deliver their paperwork to the banks. A lot of our small businesses, our first or second generation businesses, are still very paper driven, and that's just the reality of mom and pop businesses. That's the American dream realized today. But many of these lenders could not access these small", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-7", "text": "But many of these lenders could not access these small businesses. So some of our small business owners literally had to go to a bank and use the pneumatic tubes to get their paperwork to a banker so they could get their Paycheck Protection Program Loan approved. So that's a big reason why we waited for the the second round to really improve the system and expand it to small minority and women owned businesses, and meet them where they were. You know, in many ways I think the struggles of the pandemic actually haven't ended. Now we have inflation at a 40 year high, supply chain disruption, and labor shortages. Ms. Allen, we're gonna come to you first. How about for Asian American businesses during the pandemic? How is the outlook? Before the pandemic, Asian American businesses were on an upward trajectory. The Asian American community as a whole, was projected to reach $1.3 plus trillion dollars in GDP. The pandemic changed everything. Our businesses closed down faster", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}

So to answer your question, Reggie, the outlook for the future is bright, because our persistence, I believe in our own hard work that many Americans do as well. So Mr. Busby, what struggles ahead do you see for diverse business owners now that they've come through these two years, and not that it's over, but what do you see the struggles now? You know, for years, we've been going to corporate America as well as the federal government saying, Hey, we'd like to do more business with your entity.\u201d We're trying to remove any type of barrier that will allow us, or continue to keep us out of", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}

And so the first one in reference to not being able to find us, we've now created our own certification program, ByBlack.US, ByBlack.US. Now you can do two things. You can be certified as a Black-owned business, and for corporates as well as individuals and federal government agencies you can find Black-owned businesses. You know, it's inspiring to hear this collection of I'm gonna call you advocates and allies all at the same time, as we're pushing things forward. I think there's another topic I'd love to explore, and it's about financial education. Because the reality is diverse business owners statistically are less likely to seek capital, even among firms with good credit. Mr. Busby, you've mentioned in the past that Black entrepreneurs are sometimes taught to do things that don't adequately prepare them when it comes to applying for financing. So what are some of the areas that Black entrepreneurs need to know", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-10", "text": "of the areas that Black entrepreneurs need to know about when it comes to financing? If you look at the industries in which we over index, usually those are the businesses that have a more cash and carry relationship. And so under times like COVID, where we were told to go to a bank to get your finances taken care of, and many Black-owned businesses did not have that relationship. And so we're asking our business owners a couple of things. Establish your banking relationships now, because there's always going to be another pandemic. It could just be your social media page being hacked. It could be you lost your debit card. We've gotta make sure that we have relationships where the bankers, and not just a teller, not just a branch manager, but the banking decision makers understand who you are, where you want to go, and some of the challenges that you're facing to be able to help you get there long-term. Ms. Allen, if you don't mind, what are Asian American business owners", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-11", "text": "you don't mind, what are Asian American business owners lacking as far as financial literacy, and what can banks and business owners do about it? In general, there are two groups of Asian Americans in terms of financial literacy. There are those who are educated and have been investing and saving, and know how to handle their money. There are those who don't. And let me talk about those who do not. They are Asian Americans, are savers. They do put their money under their mattress. They do. And that's why during the pandemic, if they were asked to show their account, the books, they can't. And the other thing is cultural differences and language barriers. There's a lot of business out there. The financial institution just need to know where to go, how to knock, and how to approach them. Mr. Cavasos, can you tell us how being on a bank board actually opened your eyes to how lending works, and why it's important to have Latinos and Latinas represented at those tables?", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-12", "text": "to have Latinos and Latinas represented at those tables? I had the honor of serving on a bank board. I was the only Latino. It was a community bank, and I was on the loan committee and had no preconceived notions. And, but serving on the loan committee, I saw that there were Latino-owned businesses that applied for a small business loan who had a higher credit score that were denied, or they had a repayment history that was stronger than a non-Latino, or as we say in Texas an Anglo-owned business. And I literally had to raise my hand at those loan committee meetings and say, Why did that get approved, and this one didn't get approved?\u201d So I learned at a very young age to be open, to be transparent, to be vocal, not to be in any way argumentative, but to in essence clear the decks for small business owners. When I see sometimes people are doing as they try to form the very relationships with something that may not even be present", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-13", "text": "very relationships with something that may not even be present in their spaces, they don't know where to go unless there's a program that says, It may not be one in your neighborhood, but here's what you can still do.\u201d People need to be a part of a network. And for some small businesses, they don't always recognize the importance of networking. So, Ms. Allen, can you tell us about some of the programs at USPAC and how they are addressing specific challenges that members have? Asian Americans tend to be quiet and keep to their own business. But the major challenge at the very front is that Asian Americans are still considered foreigners. I see the big word behind you, Reggie. We don't belong. We do not feel that we not belong. My job as the chief executive and national president of the U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce Education Foundation, together with our regional chapters in California, Texas, Georgia, Illinois, and New Jersey, the five states with the most critical", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}

Mr. Cavasos, can you tell us about the the 3 Cs that you talk about, and why those are important? And, how does the chamber help members develop in those areas? There's no question that Hispanics have been under capitalized for years, or turned down due to discrimination. We would have an additional $2.5 trillion dollars in the U.S. economy if the under capitalized Latino-owned businesses were able to receive lending at the same level as non-Latinos in this country. So capital is vital for scaling firms, growing mom and pop businesses. We've seen where it makes a difference to open a second location or a third location to a successful business. Access to capacity building. They need the tools that they need to get ready to apply for a loan, to do a marketing plan, to", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}

Less than 1% of the U.S. government's federal contracts go to Hispanic-owned businesses. We have realized because of the pandemic that we are so interconnected more so than we ever imagined before, we need one another to be successful entrepreneurs. And we've learned that our net worth as businesses and business owners is our network. I want to transition just to one other thing, and it's, you know, Mr. Busby, do something for me. Can you tell us about the ways you reach out to Black-owned businesses through media or mentorship, and why that is important right now? I think we are at a point now where it's really about economic parity, about moving an economic agenda for Black people. And like I say, in order for there to be a great America, there's got to be great minority America. And in order to have great minority America, you gotta have great minority", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-16", "text": "great minority America, you gotta have great minority businesses. And in order to have great minority owned businesses, you have to have great minority chamber leaders. And so I'm excited about sharing my role as a president of the U.S. Black Chamber with Ramiro, as Susan, both sharing their roles of leading their communities as well as their businesses across the country. So here's what we know to be true. We all need to network. We know the importance of networking. For some people, it's frustrating. For other people, they love it. The reality is though, is that networking with peers is equally as important for mentoring and growing businesses. But there are a lot of barriers to diverse owners. So, Ms. Allen, how do you advise your members to knock down these networking barriers and be more effective networkers? Well, you know, for a long time, I've always told this story, but not heard enough among Asian American businesses, that they are the one", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-17", "text": "among Asian American businesses, that they are the one shrimp cocktail party goer. And I go to the buffet table, pick up a shrimp cocktail, eat it, and drop the drink, and leave. They don't stay around to network. And they've lost all that opportunity to create a network of their own. Watch the news, watch world news, national news, domestic news, pick up the magazine when you're at the doctor's office and read the headlines. Get to know what's going on around you. So then when you go to a networking event, you will understand what you have to say, because you will have all that content, assets inside of you. You'll be very comfortable. Building on that, Mr. Busby, what do you have to say about what does good networking look like? I live in Bowie, Maryland, and I tell the story all the time. I bought a home. I used a Black realtor. I used a Black bank. I used a Black mortgage company. I used a Black", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-18", "text": "used a Black mortgage company. I used a Black moving company. I used a Black home inspector. I used a Black installation company. Everyone that touched the transaction was Black. I was telling that story at an event. There were 25 young Black men that all used to meet on Friday mornings at 6:00 AM. And they would get together to network, to really share information, to create best practices for them to move their individual companies. I said, But what you don't know is what you don't know.\u201d They didn't know and didn't have the understanding of banking relationships. And so on a Friday morning, we took all 25 young Black men down to the bank, in their suits and ties, to make sure that they understood the importance of networking together, but more importantly having outsiders tell them best practices of things, and policies, and ideas that they might not have had on their own. So there's a couple of things that have been on my mind, and really it's banks like Wells", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-19", "text": "on my mind, and really it's banks like Wells Fargo that are doing their part to push things forward. Even in the work that I do, I tell small business owners, or marginalized populations, that one of the things you have to do is focus, like where do you spend your energy? So if you think about that energy, action, impact, momentum in order to get to progress, I'm asking you, this elite panel, where do you think small business owners should focus their energy and their time? And Mr. Cavasos, I'll start with you. Well, Reggie, it's been an honor to be here with you and Wells Fargo. And we tell our small Hispanic-owned businesses, that no matter what product that they make or what service they provide, that their focus should be on people. We're all in the people business no matter what we do. And so part of networking, part of building a small business into a multi-billion dollar business is to be focused on your customer, what their needs are,", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}
{"id": "2d6f6535c4ee-20", "text": "be focused on your customer, what their needs are, and what their focus should be. Okay, Ms. Allen, what do you have? What's that piece of advice? COVID-19 has changed a whole lot, turned the world upside down, changed the way we do business, we live, we socialize, and we conduct business. What we did in 20 and 21 are testing the ground. In 2022, we're beginning to sit back and see and say, What did we do in 2020 and 2021 that's a waste? And what did we do that is going to be useful that would take us forward?\u201d That's what I would tell my small business to do. Mr. Busby, what do you think, what's that piece of advice that you wanna share with a small business owner? Where should they focus? Great question. And I'll end with, if I was a small business owner, which I was more than half my life, and had a father that had a small business, and he used to say, Spend more time working", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/"}

So I would tell business owners to make sure that they're working on their business as much as they are working in it. So thank you, Ron, Susan, and Ramiro for sharing your insights with us. You know, the last two years, I'll admit have been difficult for many diverse small businesses, but as we've discussed their challenges are more systemic and go back far before 2020.

{"id": "351da7d91293-1", "text": "Welcome to the forum, to amplify diverse small-business voices, presented by Wells Fargo. I'm Reggie Butler, and I'll be your host. Small businesses are the backbone of the economy, making up nearly half of the workforce in the private sector. Within that, diverse businesses are among the fastest growing segment. Yet, despite their importance to the economy diverse small businesses have historically faced numerous systemic challenges that have created obstacles to their success. Then the pandemic added to these challenges, disproportionately impacting diverse owners who two years on continue to struggle against inflation, labor shortages, and supply chain disruption. Supporting small businesses is crucially important to Wells Fargo in understanding the challenges they face and the support they need is the first step to providing that support. Digging into these topics today is our esteemed panel from the Pan Asian American, Black, and Hispanic Chambers of Commerce. First, we have Susan Allen. Susan is the national president and", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}

Susan is the national president and CEO of the U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce Education Foundation and the country's leading voice for equal opportunity for Asian American businesses. Throughout her career in law and nonprofit, Susan has helped to educate and develop generations of entrepreneurs, and open doors to government and corporate contracts for a community that generates $1.3 trillion GDP. Welcome, Susan. Thank you very much. It's nice to be here. Next, we have Ramiro Cavasos, president and CEO of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the country's largest business advocacy group for Hispanics. He is an economic development expert, who previously served as CEO of the San Antonio Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and was also previously the Director of Research in Economic Development at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.

Ron also developed his skills at some of the largest corporations in America, including Xerox, IBM, and Coca-Cola. Welcome, Ron And thank you for having us, Reggie. Looking forward to the conversation today. Let's dive in and start with the big picture. Diverse businesses are so important to the American economy. Yet so many of these owners face significant challenges. So, Mr. Cavasos, why is representation important to Hispanic businesses? Why does that matter? Well, it matters because our economy depends on diverse businesses, or else we will not stay the largest economy and the strongest economy in the world. And so for us, you know, we need", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-4", "text": "world. And so for us, you know, we need to be at the table, not just because it's good social corporate responsibility, it's an economic imperative that Black, Brown, Asian, LGBTQ businesses, all of us within our chamber are represented, but that we're also present at those decision making tables. Ms. Allen, in the past, you've talked about lack of representation, and how this is a significant obstacle to Asian American business owners. Now, the question is how does this negatively affect businesses? Why is representation so important to you? I think representation in the United States Congress, where policies and laws are made that affect our daily lives is extremely important. Take a look at the last two years when COVID-19 blanketed the country with fear, economic and health devastation, and Asian Americans suffered an additional problem, anti-Asian discrimination and violence. We lost lives and property, and so much more. Two thirds of the crimes were perpetrated at places of business owned by Asian Americans.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-5", "text": "perpetrated at places of business owned by Asian Americans. But the country was silent. Mr. Busby, lack of representation is also harmful to Black-owned businesses. Do me a favor. Can you tell us how some of the unique ways that are in place right now that affect Black businesses that might be different? Well, great question, Reggie. So often Black business issues get painted under the broad brush of minority programs. And what we asked for last year were three particular specific issues. One was intentionality. We wanted to be able to understand what was happening in the Black business community, versus that of minority programs. We have seen historically that it has been white women that have benefited from minority programs. About 78% of all of the federal government contracts were awarded to white women, versus those of Black business owners only received 1.67% of all of the federal government contracts. We're asking for three things, intentionality, transparency, and then thirdly, accountability. Diverse businesses were more", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-6", "text": "then thirdly, accountability. Diverse businesses were more likely, compared to majority of white owned businesses, to experience financial and or operational challenges during the pandemic. Mr. Cavasos, why were Hispanic small diverse business owners especially challenged when it came to accessing funds, and what did you learn from that experience? Well, Reggie, there are 5 million Latino-owned businesses in America. Only 52% of those 5 million businesses had a banking relationship prior to COVID. And even before COVID they were challenged to get approval for lending, or more access to capital. A big part of the challenges of these small businesses once COVID hit was the fact that they have a lot of information. They needed more capacity to deliver their paperwork to the banks. A lot of our small businesses, our first or second generation businesses, are still very paper driven, and that's just the reality of mom and pop businesses. That's the American dream realized today. But many of these lenders could not access these small", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-7", "text": "But many of these lenders could not access these small businesses. So some of our small business owners literally had to go to a bank and use the pneumatic tubes to get their paperwork to a banker so they could get their Paycheck Protection Program Loan approved. So that's a big reason why we waited for the the second round to really improve the system and expand it to small minority and women owned businesses, and meet them where they were. You know, in many ways I think the struggles of the pandemic actually haven't ended. Now we have inflation at a 40 year high, supply chain disruption, and labor shortages. Ms. Allen, we're gonna come to you first. How about for Asian American businesses during the pandemic? How is the outlook? Before the pandemic, Asian American businesses were on an upward trajectory. The Asian American community as a whole, was projected to reach $1.3 plus trillion dollars in GDP. The pandemic changed everything. Our businesses closed down faster", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-8", "text": "pandemic changed everything. Our businesses closed down faster than any other ethnic groups, 40%, 60% across the country, and 90% in Los Angeles and New York, the biggest drop in business revenue in the country. Devastating, but 70% of Asian American community is consisted of immigrants, and sons and daughters of immigrants. That's why we are so independent. So to answer your question, Reggie, the outlook for the future is bright, because our persistence, I believe in our own hard work that many Americans do as well. So Mr. Busby, what struggles ahead do you see for diverse business owners now that they've come through these two years, and not that it's over, but what do you see the struggles now? You know, for years, we've been going to corporate America as well as the federal government saying, Hey, we'd like to do more business with your entity.\u201d We're trying to remove any type of barrier that will allow us, or continue to keep us out of", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-9", "text": "will allow us, or continue to keep us out of the game of commerce. And so the first one in reference to not being able to find us, we've now created our own certification program, ByBlack.US, ByBlack.US. Now you can do two things. You can be certified as a Black-owned business, and for corporates as well as individuals and federal government agencies you can find Black-owned businesses. You know, it's inspiring to hear this collection of I'm gonna call you advocates and allies all at the same time, as we're pushing things forward. I think there's another topic I'd love to explore, and it's about financial education. Because the reality is diverse business owners statistically are less likely to seek capital, even among firms with good credit. Mr. Busby, you've mentioned in the past that Black entrepreneurs are sometimes taught to do things that don't adequately prepare them when it comes to applying for financing. So what are some of the areas that Black entrepreneurs need to know", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-10", "text": "of the areas that Black entrepreneurs need to know about when it comes to financing? If you look at the industries in which we over index, usually those are the businesses that have a more cash and carry relationship. And so under times like COVID, where we were told to go to a bank to get your finances taken care of, and many Black-owned businesses did not have that relationship. And so we're asking our business owners a couple of things. Establish your banking relationships now, because there's always going to be another pandemic. It could just be your social media page being hacked. It could be you lost your debit card. We've gotta make sure that we have relationships where the bankers, and not just a teller, not just a branch manager, but the banking decision makers understand who you are, where you want to go, and some of the challenges that you're facing to be able to help you get there long-term. Ms. Allen, if you don't mind, what are Asian American business owners", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-11", "text": "you don't mind, what are Asian American business owners lacking as far as financial literacy, and what can banks and business owners do about it? In general, there are two groups of Asian Americans in terms of financial literacy. There are those who are educated and have been investing and saving, and know how to handle their money. There are those who don't. And let me talk about those who do not. They are Asian Americans, are savers. They do put their money under their mattress. They do. And that's why during the pandemic, if they were asked to show their account, the books, they can't. And the other thing is cultural differences and language barriers. There's a lot of business out there. The financial institution just need to know where to go, how to knock, and how to approach them. Mr. Cavasos, can you tell us how being on a bank board actually opened your eyes to how lending works, and why it's important to have Latinos and Latinas represented at those tables?", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-12", "text": "to have Latinos and Latinas represented at those tables? I had the honor of serving on a bank board. I was the only Latino. It was a community bank, and I was on the loan committee and had no preconceived notions. And, but serving on the loan committee, I saw that there were Latino-owned businesses that applied for a small business loan who had a higher credit score that were denied, or they had a repayment history that was stronger than a non-Latino, or as we say in Texas an Anglo-owned business. And I literally had to raise my hand at those loan committee meetings and say, Why did that get approved, and this one didn't get approved?\u201d So I learned at a very young age to be open, to be transparent, to be vocal, not to be in any way argumentative, but to in essence clear the decks for small business owners. When I see sometimes people are doing as they try to form the very relationships with something that may not even be present", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-13", "text": "very relationships with something that may not even be present in their spaces, they don't know where to go unless there's a program that says, It may not be one in your neighborhood, but here's what you can still do.\u201d People need to be a part of a network. And for some small businesses, they don't always recognize the importance of networking. So, Ms. Allen, can you tell us about some of the programs at USPAC and how they are addressing specific challenges that members have? Asian Americans tend to be quiet and keep to their own business. But the major challenge at the very front is that Asian Americans are still considered foreigners. I see the big word behind you, Reggie. We don't belong. We do not feel that we not belong. My job as the chief executive and national president of the U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce Education Foundation, together with our regional chapters in California, Texas, Georgia, Illinois, and New Jersey, the five states with the most critical", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-14", "text": "New Jersey, the five states with the most critical mass of Asian American population, as well as businesses, is to make sure that they come out and speak up, raise their hand, step up, volunteer. Mr. Cavasos, can you tell us about the the 3 Cs that you talk about, and why those are important? And, how does the chamber help members develop in those areas? There's no question that Hispanics have been under capitalized for years, or turned down due to discrimination. We would have an additional $2.5 trillion dollars in the U.S. economy if the under capitalized Latino-owned businesses were able to receive lending at the same level as non-Latinos in this country. So capital is vital for scaling firms, growing mom and pop businesses. We've seen where it makes a difference to open a second location or a third location to a successful business. Access to capacity building. They need the tools that they need to get ready to apply for a loan, to do a marketing plan, to", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}

Less than 1% of the U.S. government's federal contracts go to Hispanic-owned businesses. We have realized because of the pandemic that we are so interconnected more so than we ever imagined before, we need one another to be successful entrepreneurs. And we've learned that our net worth as businesses and business owners is our network. I want to transition just to one other thing, and it's, you know, Mr. Busby, do something for me. Can you tell us about the ways you reach out to Black-owned businesses through media or mentorship, and why that is important right now? I think we are at a point now where it's really about economic parity, about moving an economic agenda for Black people. And like I say, in order for there to be a great America, there's got to be great minority America. And in order to have great minority America, you gotta have great minority", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-16", "text": "great minority America, you gotta have great minority businesses. And in order to have great minority owned businesses, you have to have great minority chamber leaders. And so I'm excited about sharing my role as a president of the U.S. Black Chamber with Ramiro, as Susan, both sharing their roles of leading their communities as well as their businesses across the country. So here's what we know to be true. We all need to network. We know the importance of networking. For some people, it's frustrating. For other people, they love it. The reality is though, is that networking with peers is equally as important for mentoring and growing businesses. But there are a lot of barriers to diverse owners. So, Ms. Allen, how do you advise your members to knock down these networking barriers and be more effective networkers? Well, you know, for a long time, I've always told this story, but not heard enough among Asian American businesses, that they are the one", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-17", "text": "among Asian American businesses, that they are the one shrimp cocktail party goer. And I go to the buffet table, pick up a shrimp cocktail, eat it, and drop the drink, and leave. They don't stay around to network. And they've lost all that opportunity to create a network of their own. Watch the news, watch world news, national news, domestic news, pick up the magazine when you're at the doctor's office and read the headlines. Get to know what's going on around you. So then when you go to a networking event, you will understand what you have to say, because you will have all that content, assets inside of you. You'll be very comfortable. Building on that, Mr. Busby, what do you have to say about what does good networking look like? I live in Bowie, Maryland, and I tell the story all the time. I bought a home. I used a Black realtor. I used a Black bank. I used a Black mortgage company. I used a Black", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}

And they would get together to network, to really share information, to create best practices for them to move their individual companies. I said, But what you don't know is what you don't know.\u201d They didn't know and didn't have the understanding of banking relationships. And so on a Friday morning, we took all 25 young Black men down to the bank, in their suits and ties, to make sure that they understood the importance of networking together, but more importantly having outsiders tell them best practices of things, and policies, and ideas that they might not have had on their own. So there's a couple of things that have been on my mind, and really it's banks like Wells", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-19", "text": "on my mind, and really it's banks like Wells Fargo that are doing their part to push things forward. Even in the work that I do, I tell small business owners, or marginalized populations, that one of the things you have to do is focus, like where do you spend your energy? So if you think about that energy, action, impact, momentum in order to get to progress, I'm asking you, this elite panel, where do you think small business owners should focus their energy and their time? And Mr. Cavasos, I'll start with you. Well, Reggie, it's been an honor to be here with you and Wells Fargo. And we tell our small Hispanic-owned businesses, that no matter what product that they make or what service they provide, that their focus should be on people. We're all in the people business no matter what we do. And so part of networking, part of building a small business into a multi-billion dollar business is to be focused on your customer, what their needs are,", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}

COVID-19 has changed a whole lot, turned the world upside down, changed the way we do business, we live, we socialize, and we conduct business. What we did in 20 and 21 are testing the ground. In 2022, we're beginning to sit back and see and say, What did we do in 2020 and 2021 that's a waste? And what did we do that is going to be useful that would take us forward?\u201d That's what I would tell my small business to do. Mr. Busby, what do you think, what's that piece of advice that you wanna share with a small business owner? Where should they focus? Great question. And I'll end with, if I was a small business owner, which I was more than half my life, and had a father that had a small business, and he used to say, Spend more time working", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse/page/2/"}
{"id": "351da7d91293-21", "text": "and he used to say, Spend more time working on your business, versus working in your business.\u201d So many small business owners are doing the day to day grind, trying to make sure that they can pay their bills, that they very seldom have the time to really look at the future of what that business may be.

Whether you're running a brand-new startup looking for its first bank loan or an established company seeking high-impact investment dollars, access to capital can be a stumbling block. For fast-growing companies, angel or venture capital (VC) investors may be promising options. But these hard-charging investors aren't the right fit for every company. Here's what you need to know about them and how to prepare if you think your business might be a good candidate. How VC and angel investing work Angel investors typically provide financial backing for startups with interesting ideas while VC investors seek out businesses with growth potential. They differ mainly in whose money they are using: Angel investors are usually high-net-worth individuals who are investing their own money, while venture capitalists (VCs) are typically professionals who work for a fund that pools other investors' money. Angels and VCs take some percentage of the business's equity in exchange for a certain amount of funding, which means that these investors own a portion of the company. They expect a large return on their investments. As a result, this funding typically comes with high investor expectations and involvement. Investors usually lay out specific growth benchmarks and usually expect to see a return within three to five years. In addition, many VC and angel investors expect to be involved in decision-making.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse-owned-business-and-venture-capital-investment/"}
{"id": "7ec106360fe4-1", "text": "Is angel or VC funding right for you? The most important factors in deciding whether you should pursue this kind of funding is how fast your company is able to grow and how much room it has to scale. VC and angel investors are looking for high-growth companies, so if your trajectory is slower or smaller, look elsewhere for funding. And remember: Just because your company can scale fast doesn't mean doing so is right for you. With angel or VC funding, your company must be ready to put a large amount of money to good use quickly. Also remember that the process of seeking it out is time-consuming, typically taking founders weeks or months of full-time work. It's worth noting that women and people of color are underrepresented among both funders and funded startups, though the industry is seeking to change that. In 2020, only $1 billion of the almost $150 billion in venture capital raised by U.S. companies went to startups founded by Black entrepreneurs of any gender.1 Various angels and VC firms are actively working to diversify funded companies. In another example, a new St. Louis \u2013 based $25 million VC fund will prioritize funding startups founded by people of color.2 How to pursue angel or VC funding Don't just introduce lenders to your business: Let them get to know you, too. Use a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to show, through concrete examples, that you have the experience to run a thriving business and manage the loan well. While these details may not directly affect a lender's decision on your loan, they can help you build relationships with your banker. Seek out potential funders. Find promising connections via LinkedIn, introductions from colleagues, industry events, and social media, especially Twitter. Register with Crunchbase, a popular source of leads for angels and VCs. Connect with VCs interested in diverse founders via industry networking groups and diversity initiatives.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/diverse-owned-business-and-venture-capital-investment/"}

Think ahead about what questions to ask, such as the amount of funding on offer, the equity the funder is seeking, and the length of time they anticipate investing. Other questions to consider are:4 What percentage of the fund does this investment account for? (The higher the better, as the investor will have more incentive to help you succeed.)

It is a key indicator of the financial health of your business. A consistent, positive cash flow can help you pay expenses, invest in new opportunities, and grow your business. Below are some cash flow management strategies to consider: 1. Pay bills strategically Extend payables as long as possible and spread your payments. Don't pay all your business bills at the same time. This can drain your cash and potentially jeopardize your relationships with suppliers if you are unable to pay. Instead, review bills, sort according to priority, and stagger payment dates so the most important bills  such as rent and payroll  are paid first. Payments that are less important and more flexible can be made later. However, be sure to pay on time to avoid late charges. Also, check if you can receive discounts for paying any bills early, and then prioritize the ones that qualify. 2.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/eight-tips-for-small-business-cash-flow-management/"}

Choose the right payroll cycle Structure your payroll to mesh with your revenue stream and comply with wage and hour laws. Businesses that generate daily revenue, such as restaurants and retail, can more easily cover the cash needed for weekly payroll. But this can be a challenge for businesses with slower revenue streams, such as manufacturers or wholesalers, because cash doesn't come in as frequently. There may be a benefit to holding the cash to be paid less frequently than weekly, e.g. biweekly or monthly, provided applicable wage and hour law permits you to do so. Check with your state Department of Labor on any requirements for payroll frequency. 3. Negotiate your payments with suppliers Using suppliers with low prices may seem like the best way to improve cash flow, but flexible payment options can be more important than bottom-shelf pricing. Ask your suppliers about their payment terms. You may be able to time your payments with your cash inflows. 4.

Manage your credit policies carefully If you offer credit to customers, stand firm on your credit policies to make sure you get the cash you need. Try these strategies: Send invoices promptly, verify they've been received, and follow up right away on late payments. Require a credit check for all new customers before extending credit. Monitor your accounts to identify late-paying customers and implement a cash-on-delivery policy for chronic offenders. 6. Use a business credit card. Consider using a business credit card to pay for everyday expenses to free up cash. Then keep track of those expenses with online banking and your monthly statements. Also, take advantage of any rewards programs that can reduce your expenses, such as a certain percentage cash back on some purchases. 7. Consider a line of credit Having a line of credit provides quick access to funds when needed and can help maintain a balanced cash flow cycle. A line of credit can be used to bridge gaps between payables and receivables, buy equipment, cover seasonal or unexpected expenses, or to take advantage of growth opportunities. 8. Use technology to make and accept payments Accept online payments to collect receivables faster and use electronic fund transfers to automatically pay bills on the last day they're due. Technology should also help you keep track of where you stand. Positive cash flow is critical to your short- and long-term financial success.

Whether your business is just starting up or preparing for expansion, credit can help support your short- and long-term financial goals. You'll find there are a number of benefits to having business credit. However, before you apply, it's important to determine whether your business is ready for credit. Follow these steps to ensure your business is fully prepared to obtain financing: Review your credit history When assessing creditworthiness, both your personal and business finances matter. On the business side, a bank will determine if your business is generating a positive cash flow. On the personal side, a bank will want to know if you are generating enough income to support not only your current debt, but also the debt that you're requesting. Before you approach a lender, request a copy of your personal credit report and your business credit report, and review them carefully for accuracy. If you spot an error, file an online dispute with the three credit reporting agencies within 30 days of receiving your report. Gather financial documents Before filling out your application, locate this information and double-check it for accuracy: Business revenue reports Personal income reports Tax returns for the past three years Asset and bank account information Proof of ownership The correct legal name of the business", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/five-steps-to-consider-before-applying-for-credit/"}
{"id": "88aaa46b9939-1", "text": "Providing comprehensive and accurate information can help your application move through the process as quickly as possible. Determine how much capital you need Be prepared to tell the lender how you plan to use the money. For example, you may explain that you will use the capital to pay for additional office space and furniture or for a website redesign. Also be sure you are asking for a realistic amount to fulfill those particular goals. Construction materials, for example, have been impacted by recent supply chain issues, which has driven up costs  so a remodeling project this year may be considerably costlier than the quote you got two years ago. If you're not sure how much capital to request, consider seeking bids from several companies before filling out your loan application. This information will help your financial professional determine whether your business is currently able to take on the debt required to fund such improvements. Understand all your lending options It's important to identify all the lending options available to you and determine which one is the best choice for your business. You will also want to consider the process and the timing. For example, loan decisions below $100,000 may be based on your credit profile and basic information, while larger amounts may require a detailed review of your finances. Some things to keep in mind: Credit cards may be used for everyday purchases, including office supplies, meals, and travel. Lines of credit can help with working capital needs (such as paying for inventory) and maintaining cash flow. Term loans are designed for making specific purchases, such as equipment, vehicles, real estate, or renovations.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/five-steps-to-consider-before-applying-for-credit/"}
{"id": "88aaa46b9939-2", "text": "If you're unsure which credit product is right for your needs, discuss it in detail with your banker before you apply. Consider terms and interest rates You also have to decide how long you will need to repay your credit. There are short-, medium-, and long-term loans, and they all have positives and negatives. For example, if you expect to be able to pay back the money quickly, a short-term loan may be the best choice. Interest rates can also have a big impact on your decision. For example, loans with fixed interest rates may make it easier for you to budget, as you'll likely have fixed monthly payments. Bottom line: Just as planning and preparation can help you set the business goals that will help you succeed, planning and preparation can help you apply for and secure the funds needed to reach them. This is a good time to consult your accountant and/or financial advisor, who can explain the various trade-offs of loans and credit products  and how their rates and terms can impact you now and in the future.

It takes money to run a business. But financing isn't always easy to get: In 2021, only 31% of Asian and Hispanic business owners and 19% of Black business owners had sufficient funding to run their business, compared to 50% of white business owners.1 But Black-owned firms were only half as likely as white-owned firms to get full approval for loans, lines of credit, and cash advances.2 Building a solid business credit history can improve the odds of receiving financing. Here are five key elements to address as you build your business credit:\nA formal business entity It's important to establish a separate business entity that can establish its own credit history Incorporate your business by registering it to establish a separate legal entity such as an LLC, S-corporation, or LLP It's usually a good idea to apply for an employer identification number (EIN) from the IRS to establish additional separation between your business and personal finances, even if one isn't required. You should consult a tax or legal professional to help ensure you choose the right form of incorporation for your business. 2A business banking relationship Loans are by far the most common form of financing, sought by 76% of businesses.3 Like establishing a corporation, opening a business bank account helps establish a business as an independent entity.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/good-business-credit-and-diverse-business/"}
{"id": "882139443793-1", "text": "Like establishing a corporation, opening a business bank account helps establish a business as an independent entity. While business lenders may not specifically require you to have a business bank account, it could ease the process of applying for  and paying down  a loan or line of credit. Having an existing financial relationship with a bank could make the process more efficient. 3Trade credit Opening trade lines with your vendors can help build your business credit. Here are three important steps you can take. Talk to your vendors about opening a line of credit. Check with vendors to be sure they report their credit arrangements to the major credit bureaus. Submitting trade references to Dun & Bradstreet, which tracks business credit, can also help ensure your trade relationships are captured properly so they can help build your business credit. 4On  time payments Just as with personal credit, an established history of on-time payments creates a track record for your business that can make lenders more willing to extend business credit.\n5% of all business-to-business payments are made late.4 Notifications of late or missed payments can harm your business credit score. Make all of your business payments on time or early, if possible. If you know you'll need more time to make a payment, speak with the affected vendor or lender right away to work out a payment plan. 5Monitoring your business credit score To ensure your efforts to improve your business credit are working, it's important to monitor your score regularly. 20% of small business loans are denied due to poor business credit.5 By building and maintaining solid business credit, you raise the chances your business will get the funding it needs to grow and thrive.

Wells Fargo Skip to main content Diverse Businesses Women Entrepreneurs Small Business Resources Running your Business Growing your Business Money and your Business Search Go Supporting Diverse  Owned Small Businesses Mentors and sponsorships for growth October 2022 How diverse-owned businesses can gain access to a professional network and resources. As an entrepreneur, finding a small business mentor or sponsorship can be the key to reaching new levels of success. Studies show that diverse-owned businesses are more likely to lack access to a professional network that can connect to crucial resources like capital.1 These relationships matter. According to a 2021 Small Business Credit survey by the Federal Reserve, diverse small business owners were more likely than white-owned firms to report poor or fair financial conditions. The majority, or 79% of Asian-owned firms and 77% of Black-owned firms, reported fair or poor financial conditions compared to 54% of their white counterparts.2 One way to combat these disparities is to pursue small business sponsorships and mentorships. Sponsors and mentors are similar, but slightly different relationships; both can help business owners. Whether you're a business enterprise seeking guidance or in a position to provide it, here are some tips on how to expand your network through these relationships. Networks can be a catalyst for beneficial business partnerships and access to capital, ultimately helping business owners build financial resilience. What is the difference between a mentor and a sponsor? Mentorship centers around guidance such as coaching, goal setting, or accountability. Sponsorship includes mentorship plus resources like access to capital, key relationships, and influence to support key business endeavors.3", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/how-mentorship-and-sponsorship-can-help-business/"}
{"id": "724421b64280-1", "text": "What does an ideal mentorship relationship look like? There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to mentorship. Providing advice, guidance, and goal setting is a great start. An ideal mentor is a seasoned professional in your industry who wants to pass on what they've learned. Mentors with special expertise can provide insight on critical topics like taxation, raising capital, scaling, marketing, technology, and more. Tip: Understand what you need These relationships tend to be informal, so it helps to know what areas you need the most help in so you can seek it out. It's also a plus to find someone who relates to or understands your challenges as a diverse business owner. Small business owners looking for a mentor should also understand the kind of commitment they are looking for. Assess how much support and time your mentor can provide. Think about how often or where meetings can take place. Traditional mentoring relationships are one on one, but it could also be calls or at industry events. What does an ideal sponsorship relationship look like? Sponsorship is very much like a mentorship with added benefits. Sponsors may also provide capital, help with credentials like certifications, advocate on your behalf, or provide connections. These resources can be a catalyst for businesses to reach financial and growth milestones much faster than they would without a sponsor. Traditional sponsorship typically involves money in exchange for promotion. Sponsorships are not easy to find, but can come from many sources, including larger competitors, vendors, clients, or anyone willing to vouch for you.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/how-mentorship-and-sponsorship-can-help-business/"}
{"id": "724421b64280-2", "text": "How can diverse business owners find a sponsor or mentor? Start with your personal network and reach out. Next, attend networking events in your industry. This could include conferences, Facebook groups, or mastermind cohorts. You might also check out industry forums, local community groups, or your church or other religious organization (if that's a part of your network), and connect with established professionals on social media as appropriate. Another valuable resource is your local SCORE branch, which has mentorship opportunities specifically for Black, Latino, and Asian American business owners. Large corporations sometimes host formal mentorship and sponsorship programs and post updated information about these efforts on their websites. These programs may be part of supplier diversity programs. Tip: Boost your online presence As you do outreach, make sure that you've got a public-facing profile, such as on LinkedIn, so your contacts have something to reference. When you broadcast your businesses' activities, you are letting potential sponsors know that you are already active in your industry, which might inspire them to help you. Make the ask Once you find a potential sponsor or mentor, make the ask. For mentorships, it's important to form a relationship first. If you're discussing a sponsorship and money or something else of value will be exchanged, create written documentation such as a promissory note or assignment of shares when exchanging equity for capital. Keep at it. Expanding your network takes time. Suppliers, customers, consultants, or brand ambassadors are all places to look. No matter the arrangement, perform on the deliverables, and pay it forward to other diverse small business owners when you can. The good news is that both mentorship and sponsorship arrangements can advance the diverse business owner community as whole. No matter which side of the relationship you fall on, these mutually beneficial opportunities can be the tide that rises all boats and can support lasting business growth.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/how-mentorship-and-sponsorship-can-help-business/"}

The average cost per hire is nearly $4,700, per the Society for Human Resource Managers. To make that investment successful, it's important to consider the who, when, and how  as well as the role itself. 1. Determine the workload. Write down a list of tasks that aren't getting done that you expect a new hire to do. Examine if it's a cohesive role. Write a job description and start to think about the type of person who might be a good fit for it. 2. Set your budget. Think about what salary you can afford and then be sure to price in onboarding or training, employment insurance, and taxes like Social Security and Medicare. 3. Assess your options. Depending on the workload and your budget, explore the pros and cons of the different types of employees  salaried, hourly, temporary, intern, or contracted. 4. Cast a wide net. Post your job description and other details to job sites, message boards, and even social media. This can help you find candidates outside your immediate network, which is a good way to boost diversity and gain exposure to new people and ideas that can help your business. Action tip: Ask for references and follow through on any they offer.

Plus, you establish clear expectations that can help you define success later on. 6. Test the waters. If you're not sure about the role you're looking to fill or the skill sets you need, start with a consultant or freelancer. Either hire the person on a per-project basis or invite a candidate to work with you for a day (paid, of course) to see whether they're a good fit. Action tip: Websites that pair companies and jobs with freelancers  such as Guru or Upwork  can help you find someone with the right experience levels and within your budget. Or consider outsourcing human resources tasks to a diversity-owned staffing firm from the most current list posted by SIA (Staffing Industry Analysts). Tips for letting someone go 7. Weigh your opportunity costs. When you continue to invest in the wrong employee, you're missing out on a chance to hire the right employee who could help advance your business. 8. Analyze the fit. If an employee is a bad fit for a role, letting them go may mean they find a new job better suited to their skills. Of course, if they're a good fit for your company, consider if there may be tasks that need to be done, which might be a better fit. After all, they already know your business and brand. 9. Stick to facts. One benefit of clearly defining the jobs you hire for (tip five) is that it makes it easier to explain underperformance if it happens. If you've discussed the issues and haven't seen improvement, it may be appropriate to part ways. 10. Ask for help.

As a business owner, you manage many assets on a daily basis, but you may be overlooking an important one: intellectual property. Your intellectual property includes the intangible assets you create for your business, such as names, designs, and automated processes. And just like tangible possessions  like supplies, equipment, buildings, and inventory  your intellectual property contributes to the value and success of your business. So it needs to be monitored and protected. Here's a breakdown of common types of intellectual property and tips on how you can protect these assets. Trademarks Trademarks are the words, phrases, and symbols that differentiate your brand from others in your industry. They must be distinctive and used in commerce to sell or promote a product or service in order to qualify as trademarks. Examples: Company and product names Slogans and taglines Logos and symbols Brand colors", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/intellectual-property-what-it-is-how-to-protect-it/"}
{"id": "3f0bc3c698c6-1", "text": "Company and product names Slogans and taglines Logos and symbols Brand colors How you can protect them: Trademarks may be registered with the federal government or your state government. Federally registered trademarks protect your rights throughout the U.S., while state-registered trademarks protect your rights only within the state's territory. While you're not required to register a trademark, having a registered trademark can make it easier to challenge anyone who infringes on your trademark rights. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) provides information on how to register your trademarks at the state or national level. Federal trademarks last as long as you use them with the public to promote your goods or services. Trademark applications generally cost between $250 and $350 per class of goods or services. To see if your desired trademark is available, you can begin searching the USPTO website or with a general internet search. A trademark lawyer can help you do a more detailed search to determine the availability of your desired trademark. Copyrights A copyright grants you legal rights to anything you create that expresses or embodies an idea. It gives you exclusive rights to copy, distribute, reproduce, display, and license the work. Examples: Software Architectural designs Graphic arts Video and sound recordings Books and blog articles Databases", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/intellectual-property-what-it-is-how-to-protect-it/"}
{"id": "3f0bc3c698c6-2", "text": "Architectural designs Graphic arts Video and sound recordings Books and blog articles Databases How you can protect them: Like trademarks, you have some rights to your original work without registering the copyright at the U.S. Copyright Office. However, registering can give you more leverage if you ever need to take an infringer to court. For instance, if an employee writes an article or takes a photo within the scope of their employment, the employer is the copyright owner automatically. However, an independent contractor who writes an article or takes a photo will be the copyright owner of that asset unless they transfer the copyright through a written contract. As with trademarks, registering them officially can give you more leverage in the event of a dispute. A copyright empowers you to profit from your creative assets. You can sell your copyrighted assets and lease them in exchange for license fees and royalties. A new copyright owned by an individual typically lasts 70 years after the death of the copyright owner. A copyright owned by a limited liability company (LLC) or other legal entity will last 95 years from the first date the work was used with the public. You can file to register a copyright with the United States Copyright Office. The current online application fee for basic registrations is $45 to $65. Patents Patents are granted for new, useful inventions, and they will give you the right to prevent others from making, using, or selling your invention. Examples: Utility patents: for tangible inventions, such as products, machines, devices, and composite materials, as well as new and useful processes Design patents: the ornamental designs on manufactured products Plant patents: new varieties of plants", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/intellectual-property-what-it-is-how-to-protect-it/"}
{"id": "3f0bc3c698c6-3", "text": "How you can protect them: Patent applications can be filed in the United States with the USPTO, and internationally in the patent office of the applicable country or region. U.S. utility and plant patents have a term of 20 years, while design patents have a term of 15 years. Patents require a nonrefundable filing fee, along with issue, service, and maintenance fees. This can add up to thousands of dollars, but some small businesses qualify for discounts. Before submitting your patent application, you can (but are not required to) search existing patents and published patent applications to see if your concept has comparatively novel features. A patent lawyer can help you do a more thorough search to determine the availability of patent protection for your concept. They can also help you investigate whether any third parties have patents that could prevent you from bringing your product or service to market. Trade secrets A trade secret is a piece of confidential business information whose secrecy gives you an advantage over your competitors.

You can take legal action against those who misappropriate your trade secrets. Get started: Put protections in your business plan Intellectual property rights can help you establish your brand identity, profit off your unique assets, and prevent others from using your creations. Making them part of your business plan can help ensure nothing's missed. Start by listing all your intellectual property assets, then consider which assets need to be protected. Budget for the time and money you'll need to properly secure the rights to your creations, and outline how you plan to protect your intellectual assets.

December 2022 Whether you want to retire or start a new business, having an exit strategy can smooth the process. The COVID-19 crisis forced many small business owners to make tough decisions about whether they want to continue investing in their current business or prioritize other goals, like retiring, buying a home, or paying for a child's education. If you have assessed your situation and decided now may be the time to exit, it's important to consider the many options available, from selling part or all of your business to winding it down completely. Use these questions to help you determine your next steps. Once you've determined them, fill out our worksheet (PDF), which includes details and definitions, to help you get started. How much is your business worth? You may have a rough idea of what your business is worth based on your current revenue, profitability, or balance sheet. But if you're thinking of potential exit strategies, a ballpark figure isn't enough. You need to have a clear, detailed understanding of what your business is worth before you can decide how to move forward. There are a number of ways to value a business, which is important to consider if your sales have fluctuated a lot due to the pandemic. The asset approach to valuation tallies all tangible assets the business owns and subtracts liabilities. The market approach considers the market value of other companies in the same industry to arrive at a figure for your own business. The income approach is calculated using net cash flow, or profitability.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/is-an-exit-strategy-your-best-move/"}
{"id": "897d16b6a2f3-1", "text": "Action tip: Consider using a professional appraiser. Business appraisals are similar to home appraisals: both provide an unbiased assessment of value. Does a sale make sense? A sale may be the best way to cash in on the value in your business. But a sale doesn't make sense for everyone. To help you determine if you're ready to sell, and which type of sale might make sense, start by thinking about whether you're comfortable relinquishing control of the business and, if so, how much. Remember, there are many ways to structure a sale; it's not just selling and walking away. We recommend cutting this because we're not sure how long interest rates will beat record lows. An outright sale is the traditional idea of a sale,\u201d where you transfer ownership immediately and receive payment immediately. A partial sale involves selling a stake of your business to raise capital. This can be done so you retain majority control of your business. In a gradual sale, you offer a long-term payment plan for buyers who can't afford immediate payment. In a revenue or profit share, you may receive an upfront payment similar to in an outright sale, but the agreement also includes terms that allow you a share of revenue or profits going forward. It's important that you look for buyers who agree to your terms and vision, as there's often an intangible and emotional component to selling a business.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/is-an-exit-strategy-your-best-move/"}
{"id": "897d16b6a2f3-2", "text": "Action tip: Strategically, you may want to consider selling to a competitor. However, this can be a more complex process. If you go this route, be confident in your valuation, divulge information gradually, and be ready to walk away if they refuse to budge on terms that are important to you. Working with a team of professionals  like bankers, lawyers, or even a business broker  can help you protect your interests. Does liquidation make sense? It almost always makes sense to explore a sale first, since businesses tend to have the most value when they are operating (because of the value of your client list and other intangible assets). But in some cases, particularly if you've been shut down or operating at partial capacity, or if you have a wealth of inventory and/or machinery, liquidation may make sense. If you choose this path, consider the different types of sales for your assets: Consignment, internet or sealed bid auctions, and retail are the most common. Keep in mind that you may be charged fees if you use an intermediary to help you sell assets and that the liquidation value of assets is generally 20% less than retail value. Action tip: Experts recommend using a non-recourse bill of sale when liquidating assets. This means that the buyer accepts the risks associated with the goods they're buying. This will help you move on to new ventures with a clean slate. Are you ready for next steps? If you decide you're ready to move on, there are a number of logistical steps that you'll need to complete. You'll need to speak with vendors, lenders, and suppliers about payoff options and contract cancellations. (If you sell, these may be transfers instead of cancellations.) You'll also want to cancel or transfer all registrations, permits, and licenses associated with your business, once you're sure of your exit date.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/is-an-exit-strategy-your-best-move/"}

Here's how to know if one is right for you. Professional organizations have many potential benefits. Whether organized by industry, group, or region, they can help you connect with other business owners, access ongoing education or industry guidelines, find discounts, and tap into opportunities you might not have on your own. But not all professional organizations are created equal. They vary in structure, benefits, and fees, to name a few. Ask yourself these questions to assess whether joining a professional group makes sense  and which one is the best choice for you. 1. What type of organization should you join? Think about the challenges facing your small business and then research what networks exist that might help address them. Namely, consider which type of group  industry, affinity, or regional  makes the most sense based on the challenges you're facing. For example, an industry organization may be a good choice if you're looking for new suppliers. Plus, you might find better prices, new customers, and ongoing education to boot. Industry groups can also help boost your credibility by offering access to certifications and training. For example, patients might feel more comfortable with an optometrist who's part of a professional association. If you're looking for broad support for either your business or life, an affinity group may be a better choice. For instance, female entrepreneurs looking for ideas to help grow a business while raising a family might join a group for entrepreneur moms. Finally, regional organizations  say, a local chamber of commerce or a neighborhood association  can help you stay on top of local rules and connect with your community.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/joining-a-professional-group-to-boost-business/"}
{"id": "dc7ac8ff29de-1", "text": "If you're working through multiple challenges as a business owner, consider groups within groups. For instance, your state optometry board may have an organization of female optometrists within it. 2. What professional organizations fit your criteria? Once you've narrowed down your criteria, spend time learning more about the group, the benefits, and the requirements. Look up who founded it, how it's funded, and prominent members. Consider asking current members how they use the group and what they get out of it. If you've decided that you'd benefit the most from an affinity group and aren't concerned about location, you have a great base to start your research. For instance, a female entrepreneur might consider the National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO). If you're a female entrepreneur in manufacturing, you might look for subgroups within NAWBO. Or you could look up manufacturing groups in your area, then look to see if there's a women-only subgroup. If you're having a hard time finding groups, consider looking at aggregated lists, like this list from SCORE targeted at women. You can also look to your existing network for tips or connect with business owners facing similar challenges. Or consider starting your own group. 3. How much does it cost? Professional organizations often charge a membership fee ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars per year. Whether these dues are worth it for you financially may be a big part of your decision to join. To answer that question, start with the money itself. What discounts will you be able to access as a member? Are there perks (like free subscriptions) that can help reduce other costs? Next, think about some of the soft\u201d opportunities you might be able to access. These are things that are harder to quantify but will ultimately boost your bottom line: access to potential new clients, webinars and ongoing education, or enhanced publicity, for example.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/joining-a-professional-group-to-boost-business/"}

What will I need to contribute as a member and what will I get out of it? Consider the norms, requirements, and standards of the group when joining. You might be required to join a certain number of events each year to stay a member in good standing. Even if there are no minimum requirements, many professional organizations (and many networking experts) advise giving more than you take as the best approach. Do you have time, advice, or other resources to share? If the answer is no, you might risk disappointing your new network, which might harm your business, rather than help. Carve out a block of time to check in with the network. Doing this even once a quarter can help remind you why you joined the organization and ensure you take advantage of its benefits. Professional groups and networks can be a great way to grow your business and connect to other small business owners. Joining, and staying involved afterward, is a good idea as long as the group is helping you achieve your goals. The best groups are those with active, involved members who want to be there and see a clear benefit.

Many women struggle to balance being a strong leader with being likeable\u201d or feminine.\u201d But digging into the research on how men and women lead differently, and which leadership styles yield results, could help empower women leaders. That's because a growing body of research shows women possess unique qualities that make them highly effective leaders. Men and women tend to lead differently Across businesses of all sizes, men and women tend to have inherently different leadership styles. Women tend to be transformational leaders: they emphasize collaboration, morale, and motivation, as well as performance and communication. Transformational leaders define success more broadly than just meeting goals; they want their team to become better people. Men, on the other hand, tend to be transactional leaders: they are goal-oriented and want their team to meet expectations and be accountable. There may be less emphasis on the process for achieving these goals.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/leadership-styles-why-being-a-woman-may-be-an-asset/"}

This can help you identify strengths and weaknesses as a leader. The rise of transformational leadership Transactional leadership has long been the norm, particularly when it comes to running a business, where output and efficiency are key. Women who are transformational leaders might struggle in this context, and many women report feeling pressure to change how they lead. But this may not be the best solution, as more people recognize the value of transformational leaders of every gender (noteworthy transformational leaders include Oprah, Nelson Mandela, and Virgin CEO Richard Branson). While transactional leaders focus on output by setting goals, transformational leaders might notice that increased morale improves output. And that can be a very effective approach: A report from December 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, showed women are better leaders in a crisis, likely because their employees are more engaged. This heightened engagement is more common with transformational leaders. Recently, Harvard Business Review reviewed the research on the different ways men and women approach leadership. The result: They suggested male leaders emulate women  not the other way around. The importance of soft skills Transformational leaders need to be good at more than just business. They must also possess soft skills, or habits based in emotional intelligence (EQ). These skills  which refer to how you work and interact with people  can be vital to running a business. And they may come easier to women. A recent study looked at 12 soft skills proven to impact business performance, including empathy, self-awareness, mentorship, adaptability, conflict management, inspiration, and teamwork. Women outscored men in 11 of the 12. Embracing soft skills, rather than suppressing them, can help entrepreneurs navigate big decisions, high-pressure situations, conflict resolution, and constructive criticism.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/leadership-styles-why-being-a-woman-may-be-an-asset/"}

Depending on the type of business you do, you may have begun to update your payment systems to account for this preference. Wherever you are in the process, though, there may be an opportunity to do more. Contactless payments are still gaining in popularity, and soon customers may be expecting a variety of contactless options everywhere they go. Look for your type of business below and see what might be a good move for you. For traditionally cash-only businesses Consider a food truck, small convenience store, or barber shop  small businesses that may deal primarily in cash. Customers began carrying less cash during COVID-19; they wanted to pay in a safer way using contactless payments. Now many people are out of the habit of carrying cash or they may not have as much cash on hand as they once did. Business owners can adapt to this shift by making an effort to accept digital payments as well as debit and credit cards. Digital payment options include platforms that allow customers to pay you directly, from their bank account to yours. One example is Zelle\u00ae, which allows you to receive payments typically within minutes,1 using your business (or personal) email address or U.S. mobile number. You can also consider accepting debit and credit cards, either in plastic form or from a customer's digital wallet via a platform like Apple Pay2, Google Pay3, or Samsung Pay4. If fees were an impediment in the past, keep in mind that accepting cards may expand your customer base, which can help offset those fees.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/make-the-shift-to-contactless-payments/"}
{"id": "fbaf25674dba-1", "text": "Action tip: Research digital payment options as well as point-of-sale (POS) payment systems that can help you move away from cash and toward contactless payments. For businesses that accept cards in person The COVID-19 crisis prompted some businesses to think beyond accepting debit and credit cards in store. Some businesses are allowing customers to pay by phone, while some are setting up e-commerce, so customers can buy online, then get their goods via in-store pickup, at curbside, or from a shipping or delivery service. While accepting card payments by phone or online may carry different fees than using a point-of-sale device, allowing customers to shop and pay however they're most comfortable may help boost business. Action tip: If you don't have a website, investigate how you can still take card payments online or by phone using web-based solutions. You can also create a website and add an e-commerce feature. Businesses with brick-and-mortar locations might also go contactless in-store by using a POS system with near-field communication (NFC) technology. This means devices can communicate from a few inches apart so customers can place their smartphone, credit or debit card near your POS device to complete a transaction. There's no contact required, and the process is encrypted for security. Your POS equipment may already have contactless technology that you're not using. Look for the Contactless Symbol  to check. If you don't see the symbol, you may need to upgrade your device. Doing so won't limit your customers to only use tap-and-go; they can still insert or swipe their cards. Action tip: Look for POS systems that enable contactless payments in addition to swipe and dip, since tap-and-go may help your business in this environment. You can generally use these same systems to accept online payments, too.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/make-the-shift-to-contactless-payments/"}

One lawyer based in upstate New York told the ABA Journal that she added contact-free digital payment during the pandemic so clients could pay by credit card as well as checks. She did this in the hopes that giving clients new payment options might make it easier for them to pay on time. Plus, online payments generally sync with your accounting software automatically so you can send e-invoices and streamline accounts receivable. Action tip: Research online payments or you can talk to your banker about options. Some systems may require specialized software. For businesses that use billing and accept cards in person Many healthcare practices, professional services firms, and other companies that primarily accept payments from other businesses need ways to accept payments in person, using POS systems. But they may also need to be set up for billing or invoicing patients, clients, and customers. To reduce in-person contact, these businesses have a few options. One option is to switch to a contactless POS system to help minimize contact at checkout. Another would be offering clients the option of paying online or by phone. Or you might want to invoice for everything, billing clients for transactions that you normally do in person. (If you need help updating your billing software to be more efficient, and to reduce contact even further, see For service-based businesses that use billing.) Action tip: Upgrade your billing system to accept online payments and add a contact-free payment option to your physical location.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/make-the-shift-to-contactless-payments/"}

If you're a small business owner or a hopeful entrepreneur, you may be able to access a microloan to start or grow your business. Here's what you should know about microloans, how to find them, and how to apply for them. What is a microloan? A microloan is a short-term loan (from six months to five years) up to $50,000. There are many types of microloans, but we'll focus on those funded by the Small Business Administration (SBA) in this article, as they tend to offer more favorable terms and more protections for borrowers. Keep in mind, the SBA offers traditional\u201d loans, as far as size and terms, via lenders like Wells Fargo. The SBA also helps fund microloans, which tend to be offered via nonprofit community groups who often offer management and technical assistance for business owners.

Microlenders typically offer more flexible terms. For example, a microlender may be able to finance your business based on a business plan and your projections for cash flow. They often require some form of collateral, however, as well as the personal guarantee of the business owner. Each microlender is looking for someone with a good business idea who, for some reason or another, can't get access to capital. While microloans may be just right for some businesses, they are typically best for borrowers with limited working capital and little to no credit history. Many times they are offered specifically to borrowers in underdeveloped communities and countries or prioritized for minority business owners, female business owners, and low-income applicants. In determining whether to lend, the most important criteria a microlender will look for are a strong business vision, an understanding of the marketplace and the competitive landscape, and", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/microloans-what-you-need-to-know/"}

Since many microlenders also offer support for business owners, not knowing these things may not be a deal breaker. The microlender may also be able to help you develop business plans, understand how much you need to borrow, and even walk you through the application. What can microloans be used for? Depending on how a microlender is financed, a microloan can be used for working capital, inventory or supplies, furniture or fixtures, machinery or equipment, or real estate. They cannot be used to refinance existing debt. How to find and apply for a microloan First, find an organization. The SBA provides a tool that can help you search for microlenders in your area. (Wells Fargo supports many of these microlending organizations.) Once you find an organization that fits your needs, find out what it requires to apply for a microloan.

Many small businesses go without employing treasury management solutions. Sometimes this is because they're not familiar with them, and other times it's because they feel they're doing fine without them. Simply put, treasury management solutions help a business manage their payables (money going out) and receivables (money coming in). In reality, even small businesses can benefit from convenient options for managing these aspects of cash flow. Why? The more time a business leader spends on administrative tasks like bills, payroll, and receivables, the less time they have to invest in strategic activities like sales growth and marketing improvements. An overview of top treasury management solutions When it comes to day-to-day cash flow management, accounting software isn't the only resource to consider. For instance, if your business receives checks from customers, vendors, and suppliers, how much time do you spend taking trips to the bank to make those deposits? Consider switching to electronic deposits wherever possible to potentially improve cash flow management, keep your deposits safer, and save you some time. You'll also be notified more quickly if any deposited items are not good. Faster notification of returned items can help your business improve information collection and cash flow predictability. Specifically, here are some ways treasury management can help smaller businesses: Accept deposits and credit card payments. Make payroll, vendor, and tax payments. Paint a correct, current, and comprehensive portrait of their financial health. Send domestic, international, and foreign exchange (FX) wires.

Manufacturers, distributors, and retailers may all be affected  as well as the businesses that serve them. Whether you're directly or indirectly impacted, this article can help you better understand why the disruptions are occurring and how to best prepare. Why the disruption? For years, most business owners in the U.S. favored a just-in-time\u201d inventory system, where businesses keep just enough supplies on hand to meet demand. The strategy frees up cash and avoids waste. But it means there isn't as much flexibility when habits or circumstances change. Consider the food supply chain.

{"id": "94db52bc5684-2", "text": "After COVID-19 hit, staff shortages sometimes meant that trucks and ships were stuck in a distribution center or in a port for days. Food supply companies had to adjust  sometimes from week to week  based on which route had the fewest problems. In some cases, they (or the restaurants they supply) wound up investing in additional cold storage (either on site or at another facility) so they could order in bulk (in case of a future delays). In other cases, manufacturing and production delays (as with computer chips for cars) and high demand for certain items (as with lumber for home building) led to disruptions in the supply chain that affected a variety of businesses (small and large). Because of the potential for disruption at any and every stage of a product's journey  from raw material to end consumer  it has become very difficult to predict problems and find alternate options.

For instance, a wholesale business that switched from a supplier in China to one in Mexico at the beginning of the pandemic may have had to switch suppliers again when Mexico experienced a surge in COVID-19 cases. That same business may have shifted suppliers several more times in the months since, and they may need to continue to do so indefinitely. If you purchase supplies from another person or company, you're likely at risk. The degree of risk can depend on the location of supplier, the relationship you have with them, and the type of supply you purchase. To help plan ahead, monitor things as best you can.

{"id": "94db52bc5684-4", "text": "Action tip: Read local news from the areas where your suppliers are located. What you can do If you can no longer get the same supplies at the same price or if you're worried that could happen, there are some important questions to consider: Can you adjust your operations? If your business has enough cash on hand, consider adding inventory for the short term to protect against potential disruptions. Plan ahead by asking suppliers if you can stock up. Ask about discounts for orders exceeding your typical buy. Can you replace the supply with an alternative? If yes, take into account differences in price and quality. Can you find a new supplier? If you can't adjust the type of supply you need, look into finding a different qualified supplier. The same questions around price and quality apply. How flexible is your pricing? If the cost of your supplies go up, can you pass the increase on to customers or will it eat into your margins? Remember that passing costs on to customers carries risk. Can you update your products? A change in materials or suppliers could present an opportunity. If you're a jewelry maker affected by higher silver prices, you might consider silver plating on some designs. Can you handle a delay? Some of your customers might be willing to accept a delay in exchange for the same product. Ask suppliers if you can get the same supplies at a later time. (You may be able to ask for a discount, too, in exchange for waiting.) Not every business will experience a supply chain disruption directly. However, understanding what's happening with supply chains and the cost of raw materials can help savvy business owners with forecasts and future planning. If you expect a disruption, think through which solutions make the most sense for your business.

Women-led businesses are on the rise, and more specifically those led by women of color in the Black and Latinx communities. Between 2007 and 2018, women-owned businesses grew by 58 percent. During that time, Latina-owned businesses grew 172 percent and Black women-owned businesses grew 164 percent.1 Asian-American women-owned businesses grew faster than women-owned businesses overall.2 But this surge in entrepreneurship faced a hurdle in 2020: COVID-19 disproportionately affected minority-owned businesses. And for all of the gains, a 2021 report by the Department of Commerce highlighted that nearly 83 percent of female business owners are white.3 Add to that an overall lack of mentorship and business resources available to these communities, and it's clear why businesses led by female minorities face unique challenges. To help address those challenges, as well as potential issues finding funding, we've compiled a list of resources to help Black, Asian-American, and Latina women business owners. The Growth Initiative from the National Minority Supplier Development Council allows certified minority-owned business enterprises (MBEs) to access equity capital from institutional investors with the National Association of Investment Companies (NAIC), a network of diverse private-equity firms and hedge funds. Accion, a nonprofit lending network, helps underserved entrepreneurs including low-income entrepreneurs, women, and entrepreneurs of color. Opportunity Fund provides loans to low- and moderate-income businesses in the arts, and those promoting economic and social justice. The group is focused on helping African Americans achieve representation in more traditional seats of power.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/resources-to-help-black-asian-american-and-latina-women-entrepreneurs/"}

Wells Fargo Skip to main content Diverse Businesses Women Entrepreneurs Small Business Resources Running your Business Growing your Business Money and your Business Search Go Selling real estate? Learn about a 1031 exchange March 2023 This IRS tax rule can help owners save on capital gains taxes by reinvesting in their business. Selling a building, property, or other business-related real estate is a big step for any business owner. While tax implications of a large asset sale may seem overwhelming, understanding Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code can help you save money and build your business\u2013but only if you reinvest the proceeds appropriately. Learn more about how a 1031 exchange works, what properties qualify, and who can help you navigate the process. What is a 1031 exchange? A 1031 exchange is very straightforward. If a business owner has property they currently own, they can sell that property, and if they reinvest the proceeds into a replacement property, there's no immediate tax consequence to that particular transaction. They can defer any capital gains taxes associated with that sale. This formerly applied to other types of business assets, but changes to the tax code have limited its application to real estate assets. However, there are other limits regarding what types of real estate qualify and the required timeframe of the transaction. What types of properties qualify? To qualify as a 1031, both properties involved in the exchange must be like-kind,\u201d meaning they must be of the same nature, character, or class as defined by the IRS. A few key points to know: Most real estate properties are classified as like-kind. A property within the U.S. may only be exchanged with other real estate within the U.S. A property outside the U.S. may only be exchanged with other real estate outside the U.S.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/selling-real-estate-1031-exchange/"}
{"id": "bb88b6fe5823-1", "text": "How does the process get started? When you sell your existing investment property, you'll want to work with a qualified intermediary (QI). A QI may be a CPA with 1031 experience, a real estate attorney, or a bank, such as Wells Fargo. Typically, before the first asset is sold, its owner and the QI will enter into an exchange agreement in which the QI is designated to receive funds from the sale and will then hold and safeguard those funds throughout the transaction. A QI can also consult with the business owner on how to remain in compliance with the Internal Revenue Code. When must the transaction be completed? While the overall exchange process may differ for each transaction, there are specific deadlines that apply to any 1031 exchange. After the sale of a business asset, the business owner must identify all potential replacement assets within 45 days. They then have up to 180 days from the sale date of the original asset (or until the tax filing due date, whichever comes first) to complete the acquisition of the replacement asset or assets. Where do I start? Seeking a QI is the first step in processing a successful 1031 exchange. Make sure you work with a high-quality intermediary, such as a bank. There is no regulation over QIs so using someone with experience and knowledge is important. Also, speak with a tax advisor who can help with guidance to your particular transaction.

Here's what to know  and actions to consider taking today. Cybersecurity threats are more common than ever and a growing threat to small businesses. The shift to remote and hybrid work has provided more opportunities for security breaches  ranging from malware to stolen customer data  that businesses need to arm themselves against. Why should you be concerned? There was a 38% increase in cyberattacks worldwide in 2022, according to Check Point Research. Yet, only half of U.S. small businesses have a cybersecurity plan in place. The truth is many cybersecurity concerns can be addressed without incurring huge costs. Here are some key actions that small businesses owners in particular can consider that can make a dramatic difference in the fight against cyber threats. Keep your software up to date Out-of-date software can leave you susceptible to security breaches. To help protect yourself, ensure all devices on your network are running the latest software. Enable automatic updates and patches to your software to help protect against viruses, malware, and threats. On top of that: If you haven't already, install anti-virus, anti-spyware, and anti-malware programs for your computer systems, as well as a firewall. If you work with a technology vendor or service provider, see if they offer protective software for mobile phones or tablets. Secure your network with a firewall and use an encrypted, password-protected Virtual Private Network (VPN) to connect to the network. Avoid using unsecured public Wi-Fi networks like those found in airports, coffee shops, and convention centers.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/seven-cybersecurity-actions-you-can-take-today/"}
{"id": "7cc02df8dc12-1", "text": "Tip: Most mobile operating systems have a built-in VPNyou just need to switch it on in your device's settings. Use strong, unique usernames and passwords When setting up a device, make sure all the default names, usernames, and passwords are unique, and don't reuse passwords across multiple sites. (Admin\u201d is a standard username, and easy to guess.) Some suggestions: Use strong passwords or passphrases. Passwords should be a minimum of 12 characters (the longer the better) and use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Consider using a password manager app, which can help manage various unique passwords across different accounts. When possible, use multi-factor authentication. For example, two-factor authentication (2FA) may require a password as well as an access code sent to you via email or text. Tip: Has it been more than 6 months since you've changed your password? It takes just a few minutes and is a great way to help keep your account secure. If you think it has been compromised, change your password immediately. Manage devices and usage Define and create roles and needs for various devices so access is only granted as needed. This can help you track which hardware each employee can access and minimize access to sensitive information.

{"id": "7cc02df8dc12-2", "text": "Outline your basic asset-management policies to understand what can connect to your network and who has access to what information. Access rules should be as specific as possible to limit those who have access to certain data, resources, and applications. Train employees to keep an eye out for issues like suspicious activity, bad connections, pop-ups, or phishing, as well as how they should report those issues when they arise. Educate employees about the proper procedure for device setup, and show them how to respond when prompted for device updates or if their device is lost or stolen. If you're thinking about a bring your own device\u201d (BYOD) policy, consider the impact of employees using personal devices to access sensitive work information, and set rules or limits accordingly. Remove employee or contractor access immediately after termination This is about more than controlling what a former worker can access. Unused but active login information can provide another possible access point for a security breach. To prevent this: Make it part of the offboarding process to dedicate time to change passwords and deactivate accounts for any terminated employees. Also conduct a thorough review of a former employee's computer or device to look for other profiles or accounts related to your business that may need to be changed or closed. Be sure to collect all company devices that the employee has in their possession at the time of termination. Don't forget about your smartphone More and more of us rely on our smartphones for most of our communications and day-to-day work needs. To keep all that information safe: Enable remote tracking and data wiping on your device, so if it's stolen, you can render your data irretrievable. Have a passcode, only download applications from trusted developers, install updates regularly, and don't open attachments or click on any links received in suspicious or unsolicited texts or emails.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/seven-cybersecurity-actions-you-can-take-today/"}

Tip: Keep your backups disconnected from the internet so that hackers have no way to access them. Be proactive  and customize as you go Any cybersecurity plan begins with being proactive. The tips above can help you get started, but you should also put together a plan specific to your company, its needs, and all potential threats. When determining your cybersecurity needs, consider the types of breaches most common in your industry. For instance, if your business is cloud-based with numerous connected devices, you'll need a plan detailing how your employees access and treat secure information.

January 2023 Pros and cons of seeking private funding  and tips to build an effective pitch. For years, research has shown that female entrepreneurs are less likely than their male counterparts to seek financing from investors for their startup business. Instead, they're more likely to use credit cards and personal loans to finance their dream. But looking beyond your own bank account has its benefits, including ones you may not be aware of. Working with outside investors may allow you to access funds for expansion and improvements without taking on extra debt. What's more, investors often provide business guidance and access to their network of professionals, which can give you a competitive edge. Here's a quick overview of two common sources of investor dollars  and the pros and cons of each  plus how to decide if you should make a pitch, and what to say if you do. A quick look at private equity and venture capital Private equity (PE), simply put, refers to capital  money or other assets  invested in a privately owned business. The word equity refers to the value of the shares\u201d issued by your business to those investors. There's also a specific type of PE that's gotten a lot of press lately called venture capital (VC). PE and VC investors are similar in that both groups receive a portion of your profits when you are doing well. But there are a few key differences.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/should-you-look-for-investors/"}
{"id": "4a464bbf8a7b-1", "text": "PE investors tend to fund more well-established businesses. They often expect the majority share of your company in exchange for their investment. VCs focus on startups and early-stage businesses. They tend to take a smaller share, which exposes them to greater risk. Why do they do it? Because they see the long-term potential in the business and believe their investment will grow over time. Look into pitching female investors or women-led equity firms. Just as female managers and mentors enjoy helping other women succeed within business organizations, financially powerful women often are keen to help other women or grow their own business. The pros and cons of seeking private investors Whether you work with a VC or a PE investor, you'll gain access to the capital you need. But it's important to remember that, in exchange, you'll likely be giving up some control and future profits. Here's a quick look at some pros and cons. Pros of seeking investors: You'll avoid loan repayment, including interest payments. You may gain access to new perspectives, knowledge, and networks. You'll share the risk if things don't turn out as planned. Cons of seeking investors: You'll be giving up a percentage of your business  sometimes a majority stake, in the case of PE. You may lose some level of control and oversight regarding what you do and how you do it. You'll likely be required to pay a portion of your profits to your investors in the form of dividends, though terms of the agreement can vary.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/should-you-look-for-investors/"}

Ideally, you'll want to make sure any potential financial partners align with your overall mission and vision  and that they can offer the specific type of additional help that you need right now.

Would you benefit from access to additional resources, such as new suppliers and vendors, business mentors, or other networking opportunities? Or are you just looking for monetary support? Think carefully about where you might want or need to grow, then look for investors who are willing and able to provide that help. What is your leadership style? Would you like to continue providing hands-on direction for your business? Are you open to new ideas and new partners chiming in on ways to change and grow? How would you feel if you were left out of key decisions regarding your business? You'll want to be clear about boundaries with potential investors. What are your personal goals? Do you still want to be part of this business in the next year, five years, 10 years, or until you retire? What do you want your legacy to be? For example, are you seeking to promote equality or diversity along with your product or service? Or are you hoping to grow a business that you can pass along to the next generation?

Provide details about the market opportunity it addresses, including whether you're among the first to address this need or how your approach is different than that of competitors. This will show you're well informed on your niche. Use your time wisely. You'll have limited time to make a pitch, so edit what you've got to say and start with the most important points. For example, unless your cause or your goals are relevant to your bottom line, you don't need to talk much about your backstory. But if you launched an eco-friendly cleaning service for preschools because your toddler is highly allergic to traditional products, that may be a key differentiator that can spark interest. Share lots of data. Clearly outline for investors your business' potential for growth, both now and in the future. Make sure to do some industry research and share any findings that support your point. Do some name dropping. Consider getting certified as a woman-owned business and joining professional organizations in your industry, all of which can help you meet important people. Also connect with former coworkers and alumni, as well as any experts and celebs you might know locally or nationwide. Let investors know about any endorsements you're able to get as a result. Be willing to pivot. Particularly if you're pitching to PE inventors, keep an open mind. These business experts may suggest different paths or products for your business, which can help you grow and expand. Ask for more than you think you need. Women tend to ask for $35,000 less on average than men do, according to Fundera.

Business owners want to know about opportunities that can help them succeed. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers several such opportunities through their loan programs. The range of SBA loan possibilities might seem confusing, especially if you've never applied for an SBA loan before. Here, we'll explain how SBA loans differ from traditional business loans, demystify some of the most popular types of SBA loans, and explore what each type of loan is meant for. And yes, you can apply for an SBA loan even if you have other business loans and lines of credit. SBA loans vs. other business loans SBA loans are a lot like conventional business loans. You apply for both kinds through banks and other lending institutions, and you qualify by showing that your business is creditworthy. Also, just like conventional business loans, the funds can typically be used to build working capital, finance a project, purchase a building, etc. The difference here is in the details: Because SBA loans are backed by the government, they allow lenders to be more flexible about features like down payments, repayment terms, and collateral. Take the SBA's online quiz to make sure your business meets the requirements for receiving an SBA loan. Most popular SBA loans Most SBA-backed loans fall into three main categories: 7(a) loans, 504 loans, and microloans. Here's what to know about each. 7(a) loans: This is the SBA's most popular program.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-administration-loan-program-get-to-know-your-options/"}
{"id": "34e7a012edc0-1", "text": "What they're for: Can be used for most business needs, such as buying property or equipment. They can also be used to fund business start-up, working capital, and business acquisition  sometimes all in one loan. Terms and considerations: Most are 10 years. When loans are used to fund real estate construction or acquisition, terms can be up to 25 years. Because these loans are guaranteed by the government, they can offer more flexibility than a conventional bank loan. For example, SBA loans may have a lower down payment (10% is typically required) while conventional loans usually require substantial down payments. Keep in mind that the SBA Express program provides a streamlined approval process and an accelerated turnaround time for SBA review. 504 loans: These loans offer long-term, fixed-rate financing for major fixed assets that are likely to promote growth or lead to job creation. What they're for: Typically used for the purchase or construction of large buildings, the expansion of existing operations, or for big equipment or machinery purchases. The key piece is that the projects may have an impact on the local economy and may potentially create jobs.

{"id": "34e7a012edc0-2", "text": "Because the loans are backed by the SBA, 504 loans offer long terms (up to 25 years), low down payments, and fixed rates. The 504 loan program is managed by Certified Development Companies (CDCs), which are non-profit organizations regulated by the SBA that focus on community economic development. This program actually requires two loans: one from the CDC (which covers 40% of the total amount of the loan) and another loan from a financial institution (which covers an additional 50% of the total amount of the loan). Keep in mind that businesses will need to cover the remaining 10% of the total amount of the loan. Any business in almost any industry looking for funds to help with growth that could lead to economic development or job creation should contact a CDC about 504 loans. You can find a CDC near you through the SBA website. Microloans: A microloan is a smaller loan meant to help businesses with start-up or other costs. What they're for: Typically used for the purchase of machinery, equipment, supplies, and other start-up costs. Microloans can't be used to purchase real estate or pay existing debt. Terms and considerations: Microloans often offer lower interest rates than businesses are likely to get from online lenders, with better financing options and repayment terms of up to seven years. The average size of these loans is typically less than $50,000; the average microloan is $14,434. Know what you want to accomplish.

{"id": "b5f921d81c1c-0", "text": "Diverse Owned Business and Taking on Debt  Wells Fargo Skip to main content Diverse Businesses Women Entrepreneurs Small Business Resources Running your Business Growing your Business Money and your Business Search Go Supporting Diverse  Owned Small Businesses Five questions to ask before taking on debt for your small business December 2022 If you're willing to take on some risk, debt can be a valuable tool. Here are five key factors Diverse small business owners can be more reluctant to take on debt  whether it's due to a bad personal experience with borrowing or not wanting the burden of debt repayment. But before you write off using debt, consider its potential to help your small business grow. Debt can allow you to take advantage of a business strategy known as leverage.\u201d That means you use the loan to increase the return on the investment. Simply put, your debt may help you make more money. That may seem counterintuitive. After all, taking on debt comes with a cost  typically a monthly payment that will include interest and in some cases fees. While you might be reluctant to add another expense to your books, if you crunch the numbers, it might make more sense than you think  as long as there's a reasonable expectation you can get favorable loan terms and repay the money. Keep in mind that while a loan may not be a solution to create additional profit on a single project, it can be a powerful tool that allows a business to keep more cash on hand. And that cash can be put toward additional investments that could ultimately drive long-term growth and future profits. Let's compare two small businesses to see how a business can use leverage to potentially create more available cash to drive growth. How debt can help a small business grow XYZ Business ABC Business Uses cash to buy $100,000 worth of inventory", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-debt-and-minority-owned-business/"}
{"id": "b5f921d81c1c-1", "text": "XYZ Business ABC Business Uses cash to buy $100,000 worth of inventory Uses $50,000 of cash + a $50,000 installment loan to buy $100,000 worth of inventory Resell at $160,000 for $60,000 in profit Resell at $160,000 for $60,000 in profit $60,000 cash on hand to invest in growth $105,000* cash on hand to invest in growth There is an interest repayment of $4,500 as well as the principal repayment of $50,000 on the loan. While both businesses turn the same initial profit on this project, it leaves ABC with much more cash to invest in future growth. That's because ABC only used $50,000 in cash to purchase the inventory, compared to XYZ's $100,000 in cash. Although there's obviously risk  because there's no guarantee ABC would resell the inventory immediately  this example shows how debt gives a business more opportunities to create growth by having more available cash. 5 questions to ask yourself before taking on debt for your business While debt can be a tool to boost growth for many businesses, that doesn't mean it's the best solution for everyone. Here are five essential questions to ask yourself to help determine if taking on debt is right for your business.\n. What are my immediate and long-term business goals? You should know exactly how you will use your loan. Some possibilities might include: Buying inventory (immediate) Supporting operations (mid  to long  term) Purchasing property (long  term) Without a clear purpose for the money you'll borrow, you risk spending it in a way that won't support your business growth objectives. Whenever possible, tie your loan to an expense that has a specific, measurable revenue outcome.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-debt-and-minority-owned-business/"}
{"id": "b5f921d81c1c-2", "text": "2. What is my plan to repay debt? You should know exactly how you will use your loan. Some possibilities might include: Selling additional inventory and/or services Leasing out space to help service the debt Reducing overhead costs to increase profit margins 3. How will debt payments affect my present financial situation? This question will help you assess if your current revenue will support debt payments or cause undue strain on your cash flow, especially if the debt won't add to your business income immediately. Suppose you've crunched the numbers and have found that adding a debt payment would cause financial strain. This just means you have to go back to the drawing board. For instance, you can find a way to accelerate or increase your revenues, consider borrowing less money, or pressing pause on your plan to borrow money until you can comfortably afford the repayment. 4. What business risks do I face? Specifically, you want to identify any risk that could prevent you from repaying the loan, such as a sudden decline in revenue, increased operational costs, or staff shortages. To address these issues, you may consider adding more income streams to your business model, researching backup suppliers, or building redundancies into your staffing plans. Be as thorough as you can to address any risks that could prevent you from meeting your debt obligations. Defaulting on loans could prevent you from using debt as a tool to grow your business in the future, so it's worth assessing all of these details.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-debt-and-minority-owned-business/"}
{"id": "b5f921d81c1c-3", "text": "5. Do I have a backup plan? You've asked the questions and crunched the numbers, but there's still a chance something beyond your control happens to your business. To be safe, you should have a plan to recover or continue operations  including covering your debt service. Your backup plans might include having additional cash reserves in the form of personal or business savings. You may also explore strategic partnerships or joint ventures to help you through setbacks. Many businesses also find success in modifying their business model or pivoting when faced with emergencies that could affect cash flow. After asking yourself these questions, if you still think taking on debt could help with business growth, talk to your banker about various lending products that could meet your needs.

Grants are funds awarded by government agencies, foundations, and corporations that you don't need to repay. As such, grants can be an important source of growth for small businesses. Additionally, there are a number of grants designed specifically to help certain types of businesses. These might be businesses in a specific industry, started by women, run by veterans, and so on. If you're interested in using a grant to help fund your business, consider these tips. 1. Know where to look There are a number of city and state governments that offer grants to small businesses. For example, Connecticut's Small Business Express Program offers grants to small businesses intended to stimulate job growth. The city of Chicago's Small Business Improvement Fund helps small businesses in certain neighborhoods with property improvements. Learn more about grants for diverse small business owners. The federal government's Economic Development Agency can help you find information about funding opportunities in your area.

{"id": "60e61f7f56da-1", "text": "Ask your network about grants they've heard of in your industry or area, or whether they know of funds aimed at helping women. 2. Be prepared to apply Applying for a grant can be tedious  you're usually asked to supply a significant amount of information. But it's important to be thorough, since it can increase your chances of receiving the grant. You'll likely need to share details about your business, its finances, and how the grant will be used. The entire application process typically takes at least six weeks and may include several rounds of meetings and/or review. Even after that, you may wait another six to 12 months to get a response. If you don't receive a grant on your first application, be prepared to try again. Some companies submit dozens of applications before being chosen. Depending on your cash flow and the size of the grant in question, it may make sense to hire a professional grant writer to help with your proposal. If you don't have the funds to hire a professional, ask your network if they have any experience applying for grants; you could discover helpful advice. 3. Be both realistic and optimistic In exchange for not having to repay the money offered in a grant, they often come with terms and conditions for how the money is used. Government grants often have stricter requirements than those from private corporations (since they're funded by taxpayer dollars). The good news is, you may be able to apply for multiple grants to fulfill different needs within your business. Plus, some grants can be renewed if you're able to verify that you've used the funds as prescribed.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-owners-guide-to-grants/"}

Unless you're in a so-called recession-proof sector, surviving the lean times requires strategic and occasionally hard decisions. It can be even more difficult for diverse small business owners, who are more likely to already be in financial distress and who may face additional barriers in obtaining financing.1 Cash flow is the first priority When money gets tight, your first priority is to keep the lights on\u201d and continue to pay yourself and your employees. To do that, you need to address your cash flow. Here are a few options: Make invisible\u201d cutbacks. Look at your largest expenses first and see whether there are ways to save money that will not be noticed by customers. For example, you may be able to use utilities more efficiently or work out better deals with your suppliers. Your landlord might even be willing to renegotiate your lease if doing so prevents them from having to fill a vacancy in a difficult economy.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-preparation-for-economic-downturn/"}
{"id": "6173a8efe260-1", "text": "Research your financing options. You may hesitate to seek out a loan in a downturn because you're averse to taking on new debt or skeptical that you can find terms that will work for you. But rather than reject the idea out of hand, do some research. You may be surprised to find that there could be government loan programs or private lending options that suit you. Some opportunities are specifically aimed at diverse small business owners. For example, during the pandemic, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Coalition to Back Black Businesses began awarding $25,000 grants to Black-owned small businesses.2 Find new revenue streams. Finding new revenue streams just as the economy stalls may sound a little like jumping out of a plane and knitting a parachute on the way down, but you may find opportunities if you look. Search for options that don't appreciably increase your operating costs. Is there an online marketplace you haven't joined yet? Can you adapt your consumer-facing services for business customers? Once the economy has started moving again, you can prepare for the next downturn. Focus on building up your cash reserves and paying down debts to alleviate some of the pain if revenues decline. You can also appraise your assets and keep an eye on your business credit score. You'll have a clearer sense of your financial options, should you need financing to meet cash flow needs through a dry spell. Keep your customers and employees engaged Making ends meet is essential, but if you're really going to survive through an economic downturn, you also need to hold on to your customer base and keep your employees motivated. Here are some approaches to consider:", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-preparation-for-economic-downturn/"}
{"id": "6173a8efe260-2", "text": "Adjust your offerings. If your customers are feeling the pinch and can't spend like they used to, it may make sense to assess and adjust your products to meet your customers where they are. For instance, chocolatier Isabel Garcia Nevett responded to a looming downturn by adding coffee to the in-store menu to keep retail clients coming back to the shop.3 Reach out to your biggest spenders. If your business benefits from a small group of top customers, entice them to your business with special offers, cementing the relationship and boosting your cash flow at the same time. Boost employee morale with intangible perks. Keeping customer satisfaction high during a downturn means keeping your employees motivated, happy, and productive. Even if you're not in a position to invest more money in employee benefits, you may be able to offer intangible perks such as more flexibility to promote work-life balance, more autonomy in day-to-day work, or employee discounts that don't drastically affect your bottom line.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/small-business-preparation-for-economic-downturn/"}
{"id": "6173a8efe260-3", "text": "Address the short term, but keep an eye on the long term When a downturn hits, it can feel like your only goal is to get through the next several months. But even as you're focused on keeping all the plates spinning, you should keep the long-term health of your business in mind, especially when evaluating your financing options. Scrutinize potential loans to ensure that the terms of repayment work for you  today and tomorrow. Taking out an adjustable-rate loan, for example, may solve your immediate problems, but if interest rates are about to rise, it may not work for you in the long run. You should also be careful if you lower price points on your suite of goods and services. Try to offer slimmed-down options that meet the quality expectations customers have of your brand. At the same time, avoid lowering the sticker prices of your current offerings. It may be difficult to restore prices later. Ideally, the short-term moves you make in an economic downturn should position your business to keep growing when the economy has gotten back up to speed.\n.

You've worked hard to build your business and steer its growth. But while your leadership has been the key to your company's current success, its longer-term future depends on how well you prepare for when you're no longer at the helm. That preparation is your business succession plan. In many family businesses, knowledge about succession planning processes and strategies might be passed on from one generation to the next. But for diverse-owned businesses, that know-how isn't always easy to come by. Diverse small business owners, particularly those who are Black and Hispanic, are more likely to be first-generation entrepreneurs. Failure to create a succession plan creates risks. New leaders might be uncertain about their future with the company or aren't prepared for their roles. Lack of a plan also increases the likelihood your business won't survive your departure. On the other hand, a well-thought-out succession plan increases the chances of a smooth transition and the long-term continuation of your business. If you haven't yet tackled succession planning because you're new to the process, a few basic guidelines may help you get started. Here are some best practices for developing a strong succession plan to ensure that the business you founded will survive, succeed, and continue to build generational wealth.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/succession-planning-and-what-to-consider/"}
{"id": "2bd649fb72b5-1", "text": "What to consider in succession planning Here are a few questions to think about as you begin making your succession plans: How do you envision your business transferring to its next owner? Do you plan to pass it down to an heir? Will you hand it over to a family member, a business partner or a key employee when you retire? Or are you more likely to sell the business to an outsider when you're ready to exit? Who do you want to step into your role? If you have your eye on handpicking your successor, there are things you can do now to identify the right person. Most likely, you already have a few potential candidates in mind. Now's the time to observe how they handle their current responsibilities and determine whether they seem capable of growing into a bigger leadership role. For instance, how do they relate to other employees and customers? How well do they manage finances? How familiar are they with the overall operation of the business?

Maybe your top pick loves the idea of becoming the next CEO. Maybe they're a bit hesitant but simply need some encouragement to boost their confidence. Or maybe they have zero interest in taking over. If that's the case you should probably move on to consider other succession strategies, like selling the business outright. How will you help the next leader get ready? If you tap the next leader without taking steps to prepare them for the role, you're setting them up for failure. Start the training now by giving them more involvement in decision-making and providing them with opportunities to acquire or improve the skills they'll need to lead. Mentoring your successor-in-waiting and allowing them to shadow or rotate into various roles and responsibilities at the company  like accounting, payroll, marketing, supply chain management, and more  can ensure they gain the knowledge", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/succession-planning-and-what-to-consider/"}

Who will be in line to fill other essential senior-level roles when they become vacant  and how will you help them prepare? If there are other employees whose roles will change when you transfer the business, you may need to provide them with additional training or experience, too. How will you ensure that the selection process is fair and that you choose the people best suited for their roles? The perception that your decision is based on anything other than talent and ability can cause conflict. Some may even accuse you of favoritism or nepotism. To prevent conflict, it's beneficial to be transparent about the process and the qualities you're looking for. How do you want the ownership of the business to transfer? For instance, should it happen all at once or gradually? If you're selling, either to a family member or to an outside party, will you keep a stake in the company?

Communicating a well-developed plan to everyone involved gives your successors a chance to build the skills and confidence they'll need to take over the business. A good succession plan helps avoid family conflict by keeping everyone in the loop ahead of time about the successor you have in mind. This gives you an opportunity to explain your reasoning. If the person you'd like to tap to take over is on board with the idea, you may even want them to help shape the plan. Of course, the plan should also include a list of alternates in case your first choice isn't interested now or decides to switch career paths later. As important as it is to have a formal succession plan in place and to share it with your family members, don't think of it as set in stone. You'll need to revisit the plan from time to time to see whether changing circumstances require adjustments to it. But knowing that your succession plan will be fluid is no reason to put off making one. The sooner you plan your business succession, the better the chances that the company you built will provide a legacy and economic prosperity for your family.

Here's how the right credit products can help level things out. Steady cash flow is vital to the financial well-being of a business. But with healthy cash flow being subject to numerous factors  both internal considerations like payment policies and external factors like seasonal fluctuations  reaching financial stability can be a complex equation. Even the type of business you run can affect cash flow struggles. For the most part, medical professionals and attorneys seem to have more stable cash flow. Manufacturing businesses, however, experience ebbs and flows on a pretty regular basis. Newer businesses, as well, tend to have more instability than established ones. Credit products can potentially smooth out cash flow needs over time. Depending on whether a business needs access to credit on a quarterly, monthly, or even weekly basis, the owner can leverage credit cards, lines of credit, and loans to help stabilize cash flow. Determining which product is right for you comes down to how quickly you plan to pay it back. Here is some basic information on each of these options. When to consider a line of credit If a business owner needs to buy additional inventory or cover short-term payroll needs, a line of credit will allow them to do so. A line of credit provides businesses the flexibility to use as much (or as little) financing as they need and to pay it off either immediately or over a period time  whichever makes the most sense for their situation.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/using-credit-to-stabilize-your-cash-flow/"}
{"id": "7c861f427825-1", "text": "When to consider a loan A loan is a longer commitment  usually between 12 months and five years. A loan typically offers a lower interest rate than a line of credit, and you have to pay a set amount each month. Many small businesses like to be able to budget for that expense each month. When to use a credit card It's best to reserve credit cards for purchases that are small enough for you to pay off the debt by the following month. It's not smart to use credit cards for large purchases due to the higher interest rates. You may be better off using a line of credit, or even a loan, for those large purchases. What else to know about cash flow As you continue to explore the various types of credit available to you, ask yourself questions like: Is now the right time? In the case that I face a negative cash flow, do I have a contingency plan that will allow me to make my payments on time? Peace of mind is everything. If you know you have the ability to tap into credit in case anything comes up while running your business, you'll be able to concentrate on actually running your business rather than how you're going to cover expenses.

{"id": "bf35c15eb9e9-1", "text": "Owned Small Businesses What rising rates really mean for you May 2023 Tips on preparing for changing consumer behavior and higher rates on your loans The Federal Reserve raised interest rates seven times in 2022 to counteract inflation, and officials expect to keep rates higher through 2023. The prospect of rising rates may seem daunting for small business owners but the reality may be less worrisome. Small businesses' exposure to rising rates may be direct (for example, if you have a loan with a variable rate) or indirect (if your business is affected by changing purchase patterns as consumers react to increased rates). First, we'll review the specific risks, then we'll provide some tips for how you can prepare. Understand the risks Direct risk: Variable rate debt Business owners with variable interest rates on loans or securities will be most affected by any rate increases. Variable interest rates, also known as floating or adjustable rates, fluctuate over time based on economic conditions. Rate hikes could increase your interest payments on any loans, lines of credit (LOCs), or credit cards with variable rates, and thus the total you owe on these debts. Indirect risk: Changing consumer spending In addition, higher interest rates generally mean consumers cut back on spending, opting to save their money to receive higher rates of return. This behavior typically contributes to lower demand for goods and services. According to a September 2022 survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. households plan to decrease spending over the next year. Assess your exposure Now is the time to determine which risk, if any, is most relevant to your business. Start by reviewing the fine print on your LOCs, business loans, and business credit cards to determine whether your rates are fixed or variable or ask your lenders directly via their customer service tools.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/what-rising-rates-really-mean-for-you/"}
{"id": "bf35c15eb9e9-2", "text": "Action tip: While you're at it, check the rates on your personal credit cards, too. Likewise, assess whether your business is likely to be affected by changing consumer spending trends. Prepare for rising rates Tackle outstanding debt with variable rates. Higher rates mean it will take longer to pay off debt. Pay off as much of your loans or LOCs as possible now, as rates are expected to continue to rise. If you can't pay off all debt, try to renegotiate the terms to lock in today's lower interest rates. Action tip: Consider shifting your business and personal credit card balances to cards or loans with lower rates. Shift cash-management strategies. If you have extra cash on hand, consider moving it into CDs, money market accounts, savings accounts or other instruments that are low risk and benefit from rising rates. These vehicles will accumulate more interest when rates rise. Assess your plans for financing growth. Higher rates make it more expensive to borrow. As a result, it may be harder to access financing to expand or cover unexpected expenses. Consider seeking fixed-rate loans, such as those backed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) or another lender, which will protect you from future interest rate increases. Plan ahead for changes in consumer spending. If your industry is likely to be affected by cutbacks in consumer spending, consider bumping up your marketing efforts, such as targeting your most loyal customers and offering special promotions, to draw traffic.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/what-rising-rates-really-mean-for-you/"}

Here are 3 common approaches to figuring out a more accurate number. While women are passionate about the businesses they launch and run, Forbes has reported that female entrepreneurs tend to be more conservative\u201d than men when estimating the value of their business. The writers noted that this may be one reason female entrepreneurs are less likely to get as much financing as men: Lenders and investors look at business value before doling out support, so anyone who is undervaluing their company (even unwittingly) might be preventing their own growth. Understanding the worth of your business can also be important for women looking to protect their assets in a divorce, and it can even ensure you're not overpaying on business taxes. It can also allow you to sell your business more quickly if a great offer crosses your desk. Here's a look at three of the most common approaches to business valuation and what businesses they tend to work best for. While you may want to work with a professional appraiser to determine the best valuation method for your business, this article can help you gather key information before doing the math together. Asset-based approach Think of an asset-based approach as, You're worth what you own.\u201d This method typically adds up everything of value within the business (assets) then subtracts whatever you owe (liabilities and debts). The resulting number is often referred to as owner's equity.\u201d The asset-based approach generally looks at two main types of assets:", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/whats-your-business-worth-3-ways-to-figure-it-out/"}
{"id": "27effc8b60ce-1", "text": "Tangible assets. These are assets you can physically touch, like inventory, equipment, and real estate. It also includes assets with dollar value, like cash and the monies due to you from existing sales. Intangible assets. These assets are not physical but still have value  often because they give the business an edge in the market. This includes patents, proprietary technology, and customer loyalty.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/whats-your-business-worth-3-ways-to-figure-it-out/"}
{"id": "27effc8b60ce-2", "text": "Once the value of those assets is determined, the calculations turn to the business's liabilities or debts. These may include mortgages, equipment loans, interest payments, wages, taxes, accounts payable, and other money owed to others. The total of the business liabilities is subtracted from the asset total. Who is it best for? Businesses that have sizeable physical assets, such as real estate investments, heavy equipment, and inventory. Limitations: This approach doesn't take into consideration the ups and downs of the market or anticipated\u201d earnings and growth, which may be much higher than what your books show. Plus, the value of intangible assets can be difficult to estimate. Income-based approach This method is based on your history of spending and earnings, as well as your estimates of future payouts and income. In short, it looks at your business's likely future cash flow, minus your expected expenses. This type of calculation requires pulling out your old tax returns and doing some research on the current market and what experts expect to see", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/whats-your-business-worth-3-ways-to-figure-it-out/"}
{"id": "27effc8b60ce-3", "text": "on the current market and what experts expect to see in terms of growth.

You may also or instead do projections based on 1 year or 3 years. Keep in mind that a dollar today will likely be worth more than a dollar tomorrow, and costs typically go up, not down. Who is it best for? Service businesses, which may generate high earnings without requiring much of an outlay of cash. And businesses expecting rapid growth in the near future (based on consumer demand, for example). In fact, the resulting value may be higher than if using an asset-based or market-based approach.

{"id": "27effc8b60ce-5", "text": "If COVID-19, supply chain issues, or other factors have affected your business's recent income, discuss the details with your appraiser and/or note them in your valuation. Be prepared to explain what you're doing to improve matters in the months ahead. Market-based approach This approach compares your business to similar businesses by looking at their market value. It's similar to a realtor comparing a new listing to other houses in the same neighborhood in order to decide what to ask for their client's property. The difference in a business setting is that it may be more complicated to figure out what to include. Using the house example again, an expert would know whether your new fixtures and patio actually add to the value of your property. For example, this approach may consider your sales and market share combined with similar data of competitors. Depending on your business, it may also look at future projections  for example if you own a campground and do more business in summer than winter. Who is it best for? Small businesses that compete with bigger public firms, which provide sales data in their quarterly and annual reports. Market-based approaches can also be used as a double-check for the findings of an income-based valuation. Limitations: Since privately held companies aren't required to disclose their financial information in the same way as publicly traded companies, finding enough data to do a market-based valuation may be tough for some types of smaller businesses.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/whats-your-business-worth-3-ways-to-figure-it-out/"}

Getting started: Find a professional appraiser While various do-it-yourself\u201d tools exist for calculating business value, working with an experienced appraiser (typically, for a fixed fee) boost accuracy and confidence in the results. How to find an appraiser? You can get recommendations or referrals from the Appraisers Association of America, local business organizations, your accountant, or another trusted financial advisor.

Every small business owner needs partnerships with reliable vendors and professionals who have specialized knowledge that the owner or employees don't have. These partners could include accountants, attorneys, marketing professionals, tech consultants, and management consultants, as well as suppliers. Cultivating these relationships not only benefits individual businesses, it also can enhance the economic development of the broader community. Like many diverse small business owners, you may have a strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion by supporting other diverse businesses and your community through partnerships. Yet identifying potential partners and nurturing those relationships can sometimes be a challenge. Here are some tips to help you create and benefit from the mutual support of diverse business partnerships. Finding diverse partners Putting together a team of diverse partners can be especially difficult when there is a low representation of diverse professionals.

You can also ask for referrals. Try several tactics to expand your network. For instance, you can join area networking organizations that focus on diverse businesses, such as the local chapters of the U.S. Black Chambers, the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce. You're likely to meet other business owners in a wide range of fields through these groups. You might also reach out to more diverse, industry-specific professional organizations for accountants, attorneys, marketing specialists, or IT specialists. LinkedIn and directories of diverse businesses, which are available from a variety of business and government organizations, are also sources to find diverse partners. Group members in your local area might be potential partners or be able to refer you to others. Consider connecting with fellow participants in the Minority Business Enterprise certification process, such as through the National Minority Supplier Development Council. Some of these business owners could become potential partners or link you to other diverse business owners. Nurturing partner relationships Once you've found potential candidates for the support roles you need to fill, you may need time to build relationships before you decide to partner with them. To get started, learn what trade and professional business groups your partners or potential partners are in and join. Volunteer for committee posts, help with planning events, or sign up to be a speaker.

Once established, be sure to nurture a partnership, perhaps by touring each other's businesses, vetting or suggesting potential vendors, or helping out with a pitch or presentation Building relationships and partnerships is ongoing work. Just as any relationship requires constant care and attention, the same goes for partnerships. By sharing your expertise, others may share theirs. Offer to help other business owners if you know of a person or resource they might need.

Learning how to write a sound business plan is an essential first step toward creating a successful business. Simply put, a business plan explains exactly what your product or service is and why people want to purchase it, as well as how you will tackle any environmental and market risks. It can help you clarify what you want to achieve and plan exactly how you will reach those goals. This, in turn, can help you motivate your team, promote your business, and make key decisions. A strong business plan also serves as an important communication tool for potential investors and lenders. It will allow you to articulate your current financial status, any sources of revenue, and how you plan to meet revenue projections. Although a business plan isn't required for all types of credit, it often plays a significant role in SBA loan applications.

Yet, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that many minority-owned businesses, especially those owned by solopreneurs, have little time to devote to these efforts. There's no rule that you have to make major updates and upgrades all at once, and there are more resources available than you might think. Here's why it's worth making online upgrades part of your business plan this year  and how to find help easing into it. Get excited If you've made it this far, you may be wondering why you should bother building an online presence. It's simple: Customers and prospects today are increasingly searching for businesses online. More than half of consumers today (64%) have been using a mix of online and in-person shopping for the past 6 months, per the Bazaarvoice 2022 Shopper Experience Index. And that trend is likely to continue. PwC predicts that e-commerce is expected to make up 95% of sales by 2040. Also consider this: In recent years, nearly one-third of global consumers have begun prioritizing purchases from minority-owned businesses  especially younger generations that are also known for being digital-savvy.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/your-online-presence-is-more-important-than-ever/"}
{"id": "81fce6aafea2-1", "text": "Get verified You can start to build an online presence without investing time and money into building a website (though you may want to do that later). Many people use crowd-sourced reviews on various websites to find information about businesses, so these third-party platforms are a great way to start building a digital footprint for your company. You can register your business with review sites like Yelp and search engines like Google. (Creating a Google Business profile only takes a few minutes, though you'll be asked to verify by mail that you're the business owner. This helps protect your business but can take a few weeks.) These and other online shopping and review sites are also giving businesses a way to identify as minority-owned. For example, Google Merchant Center provides an option to identify your business as Black-owned, Latino-owned, veteran-owned, or women-owned. Google Digital Coaches also provide free training and coaching to help Black and Latinx small businesses create a thriving online presence. It may be worth your while to research what your favorite shopping sites are offering to help minority-owned businesses. Not only do consumers use these sites to discover companies, the sites themselves often provide metrics about how many people searched for your business and what percentage engaged to find out more. Action tip: Boost your relevance once you've registered your business or created a profile by asking customers to post reviews. Monitor these comments since they can help you better understand your customers, and good feedback can convince prospects to pick you.", "url": "https://smallbusinessresources.wf.com/your-online-presence-is-more-important-than-ever/"}

This is just one type of small business that shoppers are seeking on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Pinterest. Creating social media pages lets you share information without creating a full-fledged website. You can instantly communicate a product launch, for example. It also makes it easier to have two-way conversations with customers, which can be helpful if you're not sure what products or services to keep or phase out. A number of social media sites also have e-commerce options, so customers can make purchases from your business via the social platform.

Beginning on January 1, 2023, the standard mileage rates for the use of a car (also vans, pickups or panel trucks) will be: 65.5 cents per mile driven for business use, up 3 cents from the midyear increase setting the rate for the second half of 2022. 22 cents per mile driven for medical or moving purposes for qualified active-duty members of the Armed Forces, consistent with the increased midyear rate set for the second half of 2022. 14 cents per mile driven in service of charitable organizations; the rate is set by statute and remains unchanged from 2022. These rates apply to electric and hybrid-electric automobiles, as well as gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles. The standard mileage rate for business use is based on an annual study of the fixed and variable costs of operating an automobile. The rate for medical and moving purposes is based on the variable costs. It is important to note that under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, taxpayers cannot claim a miscellaneous itemized deduction for unreimbursed employee travel expenses. Taxpayers also cannot claim a deduction for moving expenses, unless they are members of the Armed Forces on active duty moving under orders to a permanent change of station.

Taxpayers may use the optional standard mileage rates to calculate the deductible costs of operating an automobile for business and certain other purposes. For the final 6 months of 2022, the standard mileage rate for business travel will be 62.5 cents per mile, up 4 cents from the rate effective at the start of the year. The new rate for deductible medical or moving expenses (available for active-duty members of the military) will be 22 cents for the remainder of 2022, up 4 cents from the rate effective at the start of 2022. These new rates become effective July 1, 2022. The IRS provided legal guidance on the new rates in Announcement 2022-13PDF, issued today. In recognition of recent gasoline price increases, the IRS made this special adjustment for the final months of 2022. The IRS normally updates the mileage rates once a year in the fall for the next calendar year. For travel from January 1 through June 30, 2022, taxpayers should use the rates set forth in Notice 2022-03PDF. \"The IRS is adjusting the standard mileage rates to better reflect the recent increase in fuel prices,\" said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig. \"We are aware a number of unusual factors have come into play involving fuel costs, and we are taking this special step to help taxpayers, businesses and others who use this rate.\u201d", "url": "https://www.irs.gov/IRS_increases_mileage_rate_for_remainder_of_2022.html"}

Generally, for income tax purposes, a single-member LLC is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner and reports its income and deductions on its owner's federal income tax return. For example, if the single-member LLC is not engaged in farming and the owner is an individual, they may use Schedule C. Sole proprietor. A sole proprietor is someone who owns an unincorporated business by themselves. You are also a sole proprietor for income tax purposes if you are an individual and the sole member of a domestic LLC unless you elect to have the LLC treated as a corporation. Independent contractor. People such as doctors, dentists, veterinarians, lawyers, accountants, contractors, subcontractors, public stenographers, or auctioneers who are in an independent trade, business, or profession in which they offer their services to the general public are generally independent contractors. However, whether they are independent contractors or employees depends on the facts in each case. The general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if the person paying for the work has the right to control or to direct only the result of the work and not how it will be done. The earnings of a person who is working as an independent contractor are subject to self-employment tax. For more information on determining whether you are an employee or independent contractor, see Pub. 15-A, Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide. Are You a Statutory Employee?

Also, you must consistently use an accounting method that clearly shows your income and expenses for the tax year. Useful Items You may want to see: Publication 538 Accounting Periods and Methods See chapter 12 for information about getting publications and forms. Accounting Periods When preparing a statement of income and expenses (generally, your income tax return), you must use your books and records for a specific interval of time called an accounting period. The annual accounting period for your income tax return is called a tax year. You can use one of the following tax years. A calendar tax year. A fiscal tax year. Unless you have a required tax year, you adopt a tax year by filing your first income tax return using that tax year. A required tax year is a tax year required under the Internal Revenue Code or the Income Tax Regulations. Calendar tax year. A calendar tax year is 12 consecutive months beginning January 1 and ending December 31. You must adopt the calendar tax year if any of the following apply. You do not keep books. You have no annual accounting period. Your present tax year does not qualify as a fiscal year. Your use of the calendar tax year is required under the Internal Revenue Code or the Income Tax Regulations. If you filed your first income tax return using the calendar tax year and you later begin business as a sole proprietor, you must continue to use the calendar tax year unless you get IRS approval to change it or are otherwise allowed to change it without IRS approval. For more information, see Change in tax year, later. If you adopt the calendar tax year, you must maintain your books and records and report your income and expenses for the period from January 1 through December 31 of each year.", "url": "https://www.irs.gov/Publication-334-(2022)-Tax-Guide-for-Small-Business.html"}
{"id": "2bee3a8e1856-37", "text": "Fiscal tax year. A fiscal tax year is 12 consecutive months ending on the last day of any month except December. A 52-53-week tax year is a fiscal tax year that varies from 52 to 53 weeks but does not have to end on the last day of a month. If you adopt a fiscal tax year, you must maintain your books and records and report your income and expenses using the same tax year. For more information on a fiscal tax year, including a 52-53-week tax year, see Pub. 538. Change in tax year. Generally, you must file Form 1128, Application To Adopt, Change, or Retain a Tax Year, to request IRS approval to change your tax year. See the Instructions for Form 1128 for exceptions. If you qualify for an automatic approval request, a user fee is not required. If you do not qualify for automatic approval, a ruling must be requested. See the Instructions for Form 1128 for information about user fees if you are requesting a ruling. Accounting Methods An accounting method is a set of rules used to determine when and how income and expenses are reported. Your accounting method includes not only the overall method of accounting you use, but also the accounting treatment you use for any material item. You choose an accounting method for your business when you file your first income tax return that includes a Schedule C for the business. After that, if you want to change your accounting method, you must generally get IRS approval. See Change in Accounting Method, later. Kinds of methods. Generally, you can use any of the following accounting methods. Cash method. An accrual method. Special methods of accounting for certain items of income and expenses. Combination method using elements of two or more of the above. You must use the same accounting method to figure your taxable income and to keep your books. Also, you must use an accounting method that clearly shows your income.", "url": "https://www.irs.gov/Publication-334-(2022)-Tax-Guide-for-Small-Business.html"}

They are separate and distinct only if you maintain complete and separate books and records for each business. Cash Method Most individuals and many sole proprietors with no inventory use the cash method because they find it easier to keep cash method records. However, if an inventory is necessary to account for your income, you must generally use an accrual method of accounting for sales and purchases, unless you are a small business taxpayer (defined later in this chapter).

If the amount you repay is over $3,000, a special rule applies. For details about the special rule, see Repayments in chapter 11 of Pub. 535. Expenses Under the cash method, you generally deduct expenses in the tax year in which you actually pay them. This includes business expenses for which you contest liability.

Accrual Method Under an accrual method of accounting, you generally report income in the year earned and deduct or capitalize expenses in the year incurred. The purpose of an accrual method of accounting is to match income and expenses in the correct year. IncomeGeneral Rule Under an accrual method, you generally include an amount in your gross income for the tax year in which all events that fix your right to receive the income have occurred and you can determine the amount with reasonable accuracy.

Dispositions of Business Property Introduction If you dispose of business property, you may have a gain or loss that you report on your tax return. However, in some cases, you may have a gain that is not taxable or a loss that is not deductible.

For more information about installment sales, see Pub. 537. Sale of a business. The sale of a business is usually not a sale of one asset. Instead, all the assets of the business are sold. Generally, when this occurs, each asset is treated as being sold separately for determining the treatment of gain or loss. Both the buyer and seller involved in the sale of a business must report to the IRS the allocation of the sales price among the business assets. Use Form 8594, Asset Acquisition Statement Under Section 1060, to provide this information. The buyer and seller should each attach Form 8594 to their federal income tax return for the year in which the sale occurred.

Next, subtract the cost of goods sold (line 4) from net receipts (line 3). The result is the gross profit from your business. Businesses that sell services. You do not have to figure the cost of goods sold if the sale of merchandise is not an income-producing factor for your business. Your gross profit is the same as your net receipts (gross receipts minus any refunds, rebates, or other allowances).

Check to make sure your records show the correct sales tax collected. If you collect state and local sales taxes imposed on you as the seller of goods or services from the buyer, you must include the amount collected in gross receipts. If you are required to collect state and local taxes imposed on the buyer and turn them over to state or local governments, you generally do not include these amounts in income.

For details on how to adjust cost of goods sold, see Merchandise withdrawn from sale in chapter 6. Inventory at end of year. Check to make sure your procedures for taking inventory are adequate. These procedures should ensure all items have been included in inventory and proper pricing techniques have been used. Use inventory forms and adding machine tapes as the only evidence for your inventory. Inventory forms are available at office supply stores. These forms have columns for recording the description, quantity, unit price, and value of each inventory item. Each page has space to record who made the physical count, who priced the items, who made the extensions, and who proofread the calculations.

Testing Gross Profit Accuracy If you are in a retail or wholesale business, you can check the accuracy of your gross profit figure. First, divide gross profit by net receipts. The resulting percentage measures the average spread between the merchandise cost of goods sold and the selling price. Next, compare this percentage to your markup policy. Little or no difference between these two percentages shows that your gross profit figure is accurate. A large difference between these percentages may show that you did not accurately figure sales, purchases, inventory, or other items of cost. You should determine the reason for the difference. Example. Joe Able operates a retail business. On the average, he marks up his merchandise so that he will realize a gross profit of 331/3% on its sales. The net receipts (gross receipts minus returns and allowances) shown on his income statement are $300,000. His cost of goods sold is $200,000. This results in a gross profit of $100,000 ($300,000 \u2212 $200,000). To test the accuracy of this year's results, Joe divides gross profit ($100,000) by net receipts ($300,000). The resulting 331/3% confirms his markup percentage of 331/3%. Additions to Gross Profit If your business has income from a source other than its regular business operations, enter the income on line 6 of Schedule C and add it to gross profit. The result is gross business income. Some examples include income from an interest-bearing checking account, income from scrap sales, income from certain fuel tax credits and refunds, and amounts recovered from bad debts. 8.

You can deduct interest on a debt only if you meet all of the following requirements. You are legally liable for that debt. Both you and the lender intend that the debt be repaid. You and the lender have a true debtor-creditor relationship. Certain taxpayers are required to limit their business interest expense deduction. See the Instructions for Form 8990 to determine whether you are required to limit your business interest expense deduction, who is required to file Form 8990, and how certain businesses may elect out of the business interest expense limitation. You cannot deduct on Schedule C the interest you paid on personal loans. If a loan is part business and part personal, you must divide the interest between the personal part and the business part.", "url": "https://www.irs.gov/Publication-334-(2022)-Tax-Guide-for-Small-Business.html"}

Figuring Net Profit or Loss Introduction After figuring your business income and expenses, you are ready to figure the net profit or net loss from your business. You do this by subtracting business expenses from business income. If your expenses are less than your income, the difference is net profit and becomes part of your income on line 3 of Schedule 1 (Form 1040). If your expenses are more than your income, the difference is a net loss. You can usually deduct it from gross income on line 3 of Schedule 1 (Form 1040). But in some situations your loss is limited. This chapter briefly explains three of those situations. Other situations that may limit your loss are explained in the instructions for Schedule C, line G and line 32. .

Figuring Earnings Subject to SE Tax Methods for Figuring Net Earnings There are three ways to figure net earnings from self-employment. The regular method. The nonfarm optional method. The farm optional method. You must use the regular method to the extent you do not use one or both of the optional methods.", "url": "https://www.irs.gov/Publication-334-(2022)-Tax-Guide-for-Small-Business.html"}

Paying more SE tax could result in your getting higher benefits when you retire. Using the optional methods may also decrease your AGI due to the deduction for one-half of SE tax on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, which may affect your eligibility for credits, deductions, or other items that are subject to an AGI limit. Figure your AGI with and without using the optional methods to see if the optional methods will benefit you. If you use either or both optional methods, you must figure and pay the SE tax due under these methods even if you would have had a smaller tax or no tax using the regular method. The optional methods may be used only to figure your SE tax. To figure your income tax, include your actual earnings in gross income, regardless of which method you use to determine SE tax. Regular Method To figure net earnings using the regular method, multiply your self-employment earnings by 92.35% (0.9235).

See Revenue Procedure 2001-28 for examples of limited-use property and property that isn't limited-use property. Leases over $250,000. Special rules are provided for certain leases of tangible property. The rules apply if the lease calls for total payments of more than $250,000 and any of the following apply. Rents increase during the lease. Rents decrease during the lease. Rents are deferred (rent is payable after the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the use occurs and the rent is allocated). Rents are prepaid (rent is payable before the end of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the use occurs and the rent is allocated). These rules do not apply if your lease specifies equal amounts of rent for each month in the lease term and all rent payments are due in the calendar year to which the rent relates (or in the preceding or following calendar year). Generally, if the special rules apply, you must use an accrual method of accounting (and time value of money principles) for your rental expenses, regardless of your overall method of accounting. In addition, in certain cases in which the IRS has determined that a lease was designed to achieve tax avoidance, you must take rent and stated or imputed interest into account under a constant rental accrual method in which the rent is treated as accruing ratably over the entire lease term.

However, they don't have to pay these taxes until July 1 of the next year (18 months later) when tax bills are issued. Under the terms of the lease, Oak becomes liable for the real estate taxes in the later year when the tax bills are issued.

The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that, according to the terms of the lease, Oak becomes liable for the real estate taxes when the owner of the property becomes liable for them.

Cost of Getting a Lease You may either enter into a new lease with the lessor of the property or get an existing lease from another lessee. Very often when you get an existing lease from another lessee, you must pay the previous lessee money to get the lease, besides having to pay the rent on the lease. If you get an existing lease on property or equipment for your business, you must generally amortize any amount you pay to get that lease over the remaining term of the lease.

A loan (mortgage or other debt) generally has OID when its proceeds are less than its principal amount. The OID is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of the loan. A loan's stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of all amounts (principal and interest) payable on it other than qualified stated interest.

Because points are prepaid interest, you generally cannot deduct the full amount in the year paid. However, you can choose to fully deduct points in the year paid if you meet certain tests.

The taxing authority must base the taxes on the assessed value of the real estate and charge them uniformly against all property under its jurisdiction. Deductible real estate taxes generally do not include taxes charged for local benefits and improvements that increase the value of the property. See Taxes for local benefits, later. Real estate taxes imposed by a foreign country are not deductible unless paid or accrued in connection with the conduct of a trade or business or for the production of income. For individual tax filers, the amount of deductible state and local real estate taxes may be subject to a $10,000 limitation. See State and local income taxes, later. If you use an accrual method, you generally cannot accrue real estate taxes until you pay them to the government authority. However, you can elect to ratably accrue the taxes during the year. See Electing to ratably accrue, later. Taxes for local benefits. Generally, you cannot deduct taxes charged for local benefits and improvements that tend to increase the value of your property. These include assessments for streets, sidewalks, water mains, sewer lines, and public parking facilities. You should increase the basis of your property by the amount of the assessment. You can deduct taxes for these local benefits only if the taxes are for maintenance, repairs, or interest charges related to those benefits.

For information on these exclusions, see Pub. 54. For information on the foreign tax credit, see Pub. 514. Accrual of foreign income taxes. If you use an accrual method and choose to take a deduction (rather than a credit) for foreign income taxes, you can deduct the taxes in the year in which the fact of the liability becomes fixed and the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy. Generally, this is the year with or within which the tax year that applies for foreign tax purposes ends or, in the case of a contested tax, the year in which the contest is resolved. Different rules may apply to determine when a foreign income tax is considered to accrue for purposes of the foreign tax credit. For more information on the foreign tax credit, see Pub. 514.

Introduction Depletion is the using up of natural resources extracted from a mineral property by mining, drilling, quarrying stone, or cutting timber. The depletion deduction allows an owner or operator to account for the reduction of the mineral property's value or basis as a result of the extraction of the natural resource. There are two ways of figuring depletion: cost depletion and percentage depletion. For oil and gas wells, mines, other natural deposits (including geothermal deposits), and mineral property, you must generally use the method that gives you the larger deduction. For standing timber, you must use cost depletion.

More than one person can have an economic interest in the same mineral deposit or timber. In the case of leased property, the depletion deduction is divided between the lessor and the lessee. You have an economic interest if both the following apply. You have acquired by investment any interest in mineral deposits or standing timber. You have a legal right to income from the extraction of the mineral or cutting of the timber to which you must look for a return of your capital investment. A contractual relationship that allows you an economic or monetary advantage from products of the mineral deposit or standing timber is not, in itself, an economic interest. . This is an Image: caution.gifDepletion is an item of tax preference under the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). See section 57. . Basis adjustment for depletion. You must reduce the basis of your property by the depletion allowed or allowable, whichever is greater, but not below zero. Mineral Property Mineral property includes oil and gas wells, mines, and other natural deposits (including geothermal deposits). For this purpose, the term property\u201d means each separate interest you own in each mineral deposit in each separate tract or parcel of land. You can treat two or more separate interests as one property or as separate properties. See section 614 and the related regulations for rules on how to treat separate mineral interests. There are two ways of figuring depletion on mineral property. Cost depletion. Percentage depletion. Generally, you must use the method that gives you the larger deduction. However, unless you are an independent producer or royalty owner, you generally cannot use percentage depletion for oil and gas wells. See Oil and Gas Wells, later.

Business Bad Debts Introduction You have a bad debt if you cannot collect money owed to you. A bad debt is either a business bad debt or a nonbusiness bad debt. This chapter discusses only business bad debts. Generally, a business bad debt is one that comes from operating your trade or business. You can deduct business bad debts on Schedule C (Form 1040) or your applicable business income tax return. All other bad debts are nonbusiness bad debts and are deductible only as short-term capital losses. For more information on nonbusiness bad debts, see Pub. 550.

A debt is closely related to your trade or business if your primary motive for incurring the debt is business related. Bad debts of a corporation (other than an S corporation) are always business bad debts. Credit sales. Business bad debts are mainly the result of credit sales to customers. Goods that have been sold, but not yet paid for, and services that have been performed, but not yet paid for, are recorded in your books as either accounts receivable or notes receivable. After a reasonable period of time, if you have tried to collect the amount due, but are unable to do so, the uncollectible part of the receivables becomes a business bad debt. Accounts or notes receivable valued at fair market value (FMV) when received are deductible only at that value, even though the FMV may be less than the face value. If you purchased an account receivable for less than its face value, and the receivable subsequently becomes worthless, the most you're allowed to deduct is the amount you paid to acquire it. . This is an Image: caution.gifYou can claim a business bad debt deduction only if the amount owed to you was previously included in gross income.

You can only claim a bad debt deduction for an uncollectible receivable if you have previously included the uncollectible amount in income. If you qualify, you can use the nonaccrual-experience method of accounting, discussed later. Under this method, you don't have to accrue income that, based on your experience, you don't expect to collect. Cash method. If you use the cash method of accounting, you generally report income when you receive payment. You can't claim a bad debt deduction for amounts owed to you because you never included those amounts in income. For example, a cash basis architect can't claim a bad debt deduction if a client fails to pay the bill because the architect's fee was never included in income. Debts from a former business. If you sell your business but retain its receivables, these debts are business debts because they arose out of your trade or business. If any of these receivables subsequently become worthless, the loss is still a business bad debt. Debt acquired from a decedent. The character of a loss from debts of a business acquired from a decedent is determined in the same way as debts acquired on the purchase of a business. The executor of the decedent's estate treats any loss from the debts as a business bad debt if the debts were closely related to the decedent's trade or business when they became worthless. Otherwise, a loss from these debts becomes a nonbusiness bad debt for the decedent's estate. Liquidation.

If a debt becomes totally worthless in the current tax year, you can deduct the entire amount minus any amount deducted in an earlier tax year when the debt was only partly worthless. You don't have to make an actual charge-off on your books to claim a bad debt deduction for a totally worthless debt. However, you may want to do so.

If the expenses are substantiated, you can deduct the allowable amount on your tax return. Because of differences between accounting methods and tax law, the amount you can deduct for tax purposes may not be the same as the amount you deduct on your business books and records. For example, you can deduct 100% of the cost of meals on your business books and records. However, only 50% of these costs are allowed by law as a tax deduction. How you deduct a business expense under a reimbursement or allowance arrangement depends on whether you have: An accountable plan, or A nonaccountable plan. If you reimburse these expenses under an accountable plan, deduct them as travel and non-entertainment-related meals expenses. If you reimburse these expenses under a nonaccountable plan, report the reimbursements as wages on Form W-2, and deduct them as wages on the appropriate line of your tax return. If you make a single payment to your employees and it includes both wages and an expense reimbursement, you must specify the amount of the reimbursement and report it accordingly. See Table 11-1. Accountable Plans An accountable plan requires your employees to meet all of the following requirements. Each employee must: Have paid or incurred deductible expenses while performing services as your employee, Adequately account to you for these expenses within a reasonable period of time, and Return any excess reimbursement or allowance within a reasonable period of time.

Getting licenses and permits in new locations is similar to getting them in your home state.

Check with state offices to find out foreign qualification requirements and fees. Pay taxes in new states and localities If you do business in a new state as a foreign qualified business, you'll typically need to pay taxes and annual report fees in the new state as well as your home state. The process for foreign qualified businesses to pay taxes is similar to any other business that needs to pay taxes in the state. Keep in mind that not every state and locality has a sales tax. In addition, most states have tax exemptions on certain items, such as food or clothing. If you charge sales tax, you need to be familiar with applicable rates. Pay taxes for online sales If your business has a physical presence in a state  such as a store, office, or warehouse  you must collect applicable state and local sales tax from your customers in that state. If you don't have a physical presence in a particular state, you're not required to collect sales taxes. Determining which sales tax to charge can be a challenge. Many retailers use online shopping  cart software that automatically calculates sales tax rates. Make sure your sales plan accounts for the various state rates.

Certified VOSBs and SDVOSBs should start the application process before their extended certification expiration date to ensure their certification does not lapse. Self-certified SDVOSBs are encouraged to submit an application in advance to ensure the certification process is complete by January 1, 2024. Eligibility requirements To apply for certification with SBA as a VOSB or SDVOSB, a firm must meet the following requirements: Be considered a small business, as defined by the size standard corresponding to any NAICS code listed in the business's SAM profile. Have no less than 51% of the business owned and controlled by one or more veterans. For certification as a SDVOSB, have no less than 51% of the business owned and controlled by one or more veterans rated as service-disabled by the VA. For those veterans who are permanently and totally disabled and unable to manage the daily business operations of their business, their business may still qualify if their spouse or appointed, permanent caregiver is assisting in that management.

New applicants certified by SBA after January 1, 2023, will receive the standard three-year certification period. Grace period for self-certified firms The NDAA 2021 grants a one-year grace period for self-certified SDVOSBs until January 1, 2024.  During the grace period, self-certified businesses have one year to file an application for SDVOSB certification and may continue to rely on their self-certification to compete for non-VA SDVOSB set-aside contracts.

Content Program benefits WOSB and EDWOSB certification improvements Program eligibility requirements Get certified as a WOSB WOSB Federal Contract program assistance Program benefits To help provide a level playing field for women business owners, the government limits competition for certain contracts to businesses that participate in the Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Federal Contract program. These contracts are for goods and services in specific industries (identified via NAICS code) where WOSBs are underrepresented. Some contracts are restricted further to economically disadvantaged women-owned small businesses (EDWOSBs). SBA maintains a list of those eligible industries and their NAICS codes. Joining the WOSB Federal Contract program makes a business eligible to compete for federal contracts reserved for the program's certified participants. These contracts are known as set-asides.\u201d Provided they are eligible, WOSB-certified firms can still compete for contract awards under other socio-economic programs, including 8(a) and HUBZone. It is important to note that WOSB certification benefits only apply to federal contracting opportunities, rather than those in the private sector. WOSB and EDWOSB certification improvements In 2020, SBA implemented Congress' changes to the WOSB Federal Contract program, as put forth in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This affected the process by which WOSBs and EDWOSBs gained program certification. Updated WOSB Federal Contract Program regulations detailing changes to the certification process were published in the Federal Register in May 2020. These changes have made it easier for qualified small businesses to participate in the WOSB Federal Contract program by improving the customer experience.

Content Get proper registrations and ID numbers Meet size standards Register with SAM Maintain compliance Cybersecurity requirements Get proper registrations and ID numbers In order to sell goods and services to the government, you'll have to register your small business. Unique Entity Identifier Before you can bid on government proposals, you need to get a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI). A UEI is a unique 12-character, alpha-numeric value. You will receive a UEI when you register with SAM at SAM.gov. Entities doing business with the federal government must use the UEI created by the system. Businesses no longer have to go to a third-party website to obtain their identifier (DUNS number). This transition allows the government to streamline the entity identification and validation process, making it easier and less burdensome to do business with the federal government. If your entity is already registered with SAM, your UEI has already been assigned to you. Learn how to view your UEI within SAM at the Federal Service Desk. Refer to the Guide to Getting a UEI if you want to get a UEI for your organization without having to complete a full entity registration. If you only conduct certain types of transactions, such as reporting as a sub-awardee, you may not need to complete an entity registration. Your entity may only need a UEI. NAICS code You'll also need to match your products and services to a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. NAICS codes classify businesses based on the particular product or service they supply. A business will generally have a primary NAICS code, but it can also have multiple NAICS codes if it sells multiple products and services. To find your NAICS code, view the NAICS code list at the U.S. Census Bureau.", "url": "https://www.sba.gov/Your-small-business-must-meet-some-basic-requirements-before-you-can-compete-for-government-contracts..html"}

These size standards define the maximum size that a business  and its affiliates  can be to qualify as a small business for a particular contract. The SBA assigns a size standard to each NAICS code. Most manufacturing companies with 500 employees or fewer, and most non-manufacturing businesses with average annual receipts under $7.5 million, will qualify as a small business. However, there are exceptions by industry. You can view these in Title 13 Part 121.201 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) or in the SBA's table of small business size standards. To determine if your business qualifies as \"small\" for government contracting purposes, use the SBA's Size Standards Tool. Register with SAM To participate in government contracting, you must register your business in the federal government's System for Award Management (SAM). SAM is a database that government agencies search to find contractors. Using SAM, you'll able to certify that your business is eligible for contracts that are reserved for small businesses. You'll also be able to represent if your business is eligible for contracts under an SBA contracting program because it is disadvantaged, women owned, veteran owned, or located in an underutilized area. Your small business' profile in SAM is like a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Creating a profile that's accurate and appealing is important to winning a government contract.

Your Wells Fargo Business Debit Card comes with Zero Liability protection at no extra cost. You will be reimbursed for unauthorized card transactions when reported promptly. Contactless cards with chip technology. Wells Fargo offers business debit cards with contactless technology, which includes a chip. The contactless feature provides a speedy and secure purchase and checkout experience. With the contactless feature, you can tap your business debit card near the Contactless Symbol displayed on a merchant terminal or Wells Fargo ATM to quickly complete your transaction. The contactless card also can be used by inserting or swiping it in the terminal. When you tap to use your contactless card, the transaction is processed using the chip's advanced encryption and safeguards to help protect your contactless transaction. Look for the Contactless Symbol so you can tap to make purchases at contactless-enabled merchant terminals, transit turnstiles, and to access Wells Fargo ATMs. Learn more about contactless cards. Chip technology. Wells Fargo Debit Cards include chip technology on the front of the card, plus the traditional magnetic stripe on the back. The chip provides added security because it is extremely difficult to counterfeit or copy when inserted into a chip-enabled terminal or ATM, and does not store any personal information. If a merchant or ATM has not yet adopted chip technology, your transaction will be processed using the magnetic stripe. Debit card alerts.

If checks you have written are returned or items are paid using the funds held, they may be subject to fees. How do you alert me when a deposit is on hold? Generally, a deposit hold is placed at the time you deposit the check. Your deposit receipt will include information about the hold. Electronic receipts may be sent through email or to your wellsfargo.com secure inbox.

We'll notify you separately via US Postal Service or email if the deposited check is returned unpaid or if that date changes. What happens if the check is returned unpaid? If the check is returned unpaid by the bank upon which it is drawn, the amount of the check will be deducted from your account. What are Wells Fargo's responsibilities regarding a deposit hold? Wells Fargo is responsible for giving you prompt notice when there is a delay in the availability of your deposited funds. Additionally, if you did not receive a notice of the deposit hold at the time you made the deposit and the check you deposited is paid, we will refund any fees that were charged due to the deposit hold. To get a refund of such fees, call: Consumer Accounts 1-800-869-3557 Business Accounts 1-800-225-5935", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/deposit-hold/"}

A Wells Fargo Merchant Services account enables you to process credit cards, debit cards, and electronic check transactions. These payment methods are convenient for your customers, and give you access to your funds as soon as the next business day when you settle into a Wells Fargo business deposit account. Or you can settle your Merchant Services funds to an account with another financial institution. Why do I have to fill out an application? Why do you have to check my credit? We ask merchants to complete an application so we can obtain information to assess the risk level that your business or organization may have when processing card payments. We review your credit as part of this assessment process. Can internationally-based merchants open a merchant account? No. Merchants physically located outside of the U.S. cannot process transactions with a Wells Fargo Merchant Services account. Currently, only merchants with a physical business address in the U.S. may process transactions with a Wells Fargo Merchant Services account. What kind of credit and debit cards can I accept? Common cards you can accept are Visa\u00ae, Mastercard\u00ae, Discover\u00ae, American Express\u00ae, and JCB. American Express and JCB are subject to processing network approval.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-3", "text": "I am opening another business location and would like to accept credit and debit cards. What do I do next? If the legal ownership of the new store is the same as your existing merchant account with us, and it is also the same type of business, we can open an additional location under your current merchant account unless you are opening an e-commerce/online location.  If the business type of your new store is different, you will need to set up a new merchant account for the new location.  If you are planning to open another location or need assistance, please contact our Wells Fargo Merchant Services Customer Service representatives at 1-800-451-5817. I want to accept a different card type than Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express. How do I accept other types of cards such as JCB, China Union Pay, etc.?

{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-4", "text": "Fees and pricing What are interchange charges? These are the variable fees charged by the payment networks for processing transactions. Wells Fargo pays these fees on its customers' behalf, directly to issuing banks (the companies that issue payment cards to your customers) and the payment networks, such as Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express, in compensation for facilitating the exchange of information and funds between your bank and your customers' banks. Factors that affect interchange charges include card type, information contained in the transaction, and how/when the transaction was processed. Depending on how you are priced, interchange charges may or may not appear on your merchant statement. What are service charges? Service charges are the amounts charged to authorize, process and settle card transactions. The service charges you pay are determined by a variety of factors such as:  Your payment processing methods (face-to-face with your customers, online, by phone or mail) The types of cards your customers use to pay you  Service charges may appear under either the Fees or Service Charges section on your merchant statement. What are monthly service charges? A monthly service fee charge covers reporting and analytics, 24/7 support, advanced risk and fraud monitoring, and may include dispute management and payment gateway access. How are my fees collected? The fees are collected monthly by an automatic deduction from the checking or savings account you specified. Transaction process", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-5", "text": "Transaction process How does the card payment process work? Here is how the card payment process works:  Customer places an order with the merchant. Merchant submits the order/transaction via their payment/point-of-sale system (POS such as a terminal, cash register, payment gateway, software). The system forwards the payment authorization request to the card issuing bank to verify the customer's card account and funds availability. The authorization (or decline) response is returned via the system to the merchant. This process typically averages around three seconds. Upon receipt of the payment authorization, the merchant fulfills the customer's order. Merchant then \"settles the batch\" of transactions through their POS system. The POS system requests from the merchant's processor to get a group or \"batch\" of authorized settled transactions. The Processor credits the funds to the merchant's account. POS systems are set up to automatically batch transactions each day. Alternatively they can be set for manual batching, which requires the merchant to close their batch of transactions on a regular basis. Wells Fargo deposits transaction funds into the merchant's deposit account. When settling to a Wells Fargo business deposit account, funds are available as soon as the next business day. What is an authorization? An authorization confirms that the cardholder number is valid for an approval on a sale amount. Approval of an authorization request by the issuing bank is confirmation that the cardholder has funds available to make the purchase. It is not a guarantee of payment. What information is included on my statement? Your statement will include a summary of your transaction processing information received, processed, and funded to your checking account. The statement can be used to determine if the deposits and funding records balance back to your internal business reporting. The recap statement is used for merchants with multiple locations. Learn more about how to read your statement in our Guide to Processing Card Payments (PDF). E  commerce processing", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-6", "text": "E  commerce processing What is a payment gateway and how does it work? The payment gateway is a link between your website (or the website hosting your goods or services) and your payment processor (Wells Fargo). When your customer makes an online purchase, the information from your website must be sent through a payment gateway to obtain an authorization and for a payment card transaction to be completed. Payment gateways work with a variety of e-commerce service providers such as shopping carts and digital wallets. Wells Fargo offers e-commerce processing through Authorize.net\u00ae, a Visa solution. You will need to agree to additional terms and conditions with Authorize.net for these services. Why do I have to post a refund/service return policy? We want to make sure your customers understand fully the product/service they're purchasing and any courses of action should they be unhappy with their purchase. By including your refund/service return policy on your website, you help reduce the likelihood of disputes from your customers. Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express also require a refund/service return policy. I already have a shopping cart. Why do I need a payment gateway? The shopping cart collects items from your customer, adds up the item's costs, calculates taxes and shipping costs, and provides a total amount to the customer. A payment gateway's function is to collect the purchaser's name, address, credit card number, and expiration date. The payment gateway securely sends this information and verifies that the purchaser has enough funds in their account at that time to pay for products ordered. Can I manually process transactions? Yes. You can manually process transactions with the virtual terminal feature included in all gateways offered by Wells Fargo Merchant Services. Virtual terminal What is a virtual terminal? For merchants looking for an alternative way to start taking payments, a virtual terminal enables you to take payments by manually keying card information into a secure site via a web browser on your own device. No development work or special equipment needed.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-7", "text": "Does a virtual terminal check AVS or CVV on the authorization? Not automatically. Merchants must initiate Address Verification Service (AVS) checks and ask customers for their Card Verification Value (CVV), Credit Card Validation (CCV), Card Verification Value2 (CVV2), etc. values. Can you import or export transaction data with a virtual terminal? You cannot import or export transaction data with a virtual terminal; however, some gateways have the ability to upload transactions in batches for processing or download batch transaction reporting. What is a virtual point of sale? A virtual POS is a browser-based application (like a virtual terminal) that is paired with a card reader to process in-person payments. Depending on your card reader's capabilities and type of card, a virtual POS allows you to accept card payments by dipping, tapping, or swiping the card. If the card reader cannot read the card's chip or magnetic stripe, you can manually enter the transaction data into the virtual POS application. Payment Card Industry (PCI) data security standards What are the PCI Data Security Standards? The PCI Data Security Standards are payment card network (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express) and industry mandated requirements for handling of credit card information, classification of merchants, and validation of merchant compliance. Merchants are responsible for the security of cardholder data and must be careful not to store certain types of data on their systems or the systems of their third party service providers. Merchants are also responsible for any damages or liability that may occur as a result of a data security breach or other non-compliance with the PCI Data Security Standards. The information security principles contained within these standards are based on ISO 17799, the internationally-recognized standard for information security practices. Do I need to comply with PCI Data Security Standards? Yes. The program encompasses all merchants and third-party service providers that store, process, or transmit cardholder data.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-8", "text": "What are the benefits of being in compliance with the PCI Data Security Standards? It is good business practice to adhere to the PCI Data Security Standards and protect cardholder information. Additionally, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover may impose fines on their member banking institutions when merchants do not comply with PCI Data Security Standards. You are contractually obligated to indemnify and reimburse us, as your acquirer, for such fines. Please note such fines could be significant, especially if your business is compromised and you have not been validated as compliant. What is cardholder data? Cardholder data is any personally identifiable data associated with a cardholder. This could be an account number, expiration date, name, address, social security number, etc. The PCI Data Security Standards apply to all cardholder data stored, processed, or transmitted. What is a Compliance Classification Level and how is a merchant's compliance classification level determined? A merchant's Compliance Classification Level is determined by annual transaction volume. The volume calculation done for you will be based on the gross number of Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover transactions processed through your merchant account. It is important to note that the PCI level is based on the annual transaction volume for one card brand. A PCI level is not determined by combining the transaction volume of different card brands. What is an IP-based POS environment? The point-of-sale (POS) environment is the environment in which a transaction takes place at a merchant location (e.g., retail store, restaurant, hotel property, gas station, supermarket, or other point-of-sale location). An Internet protocol (IP)-based POS environment is one in which transactions are stored, processed, or transmitted on IP-based systems, or systems communicating via transmission control protocol (TCP).", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-9", "text": "Could my compliance requirements change? Yes. As your transaction volume changes, as your payment solution changes, and as payment network and industry rules change, your compliance requirements may change. It is your responsibility to be continuously aware of the data security requirements that currently apply to you. Data store protocol What rules apply if a merchant does not store cardholder data? If a merchant does not store cardholder data, the PCI Data Security Standards still apply to the environment that transmits or processes cardholder data. This includes any service providers that a merchant uses. Compliance assessment What is a self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ)? The PCI Self-Assessment Questionnaire is available for download on the PCI Data Security Standards Council website. If a business chooses to enroll with one of the PCI Security Standards Council Qualified Security Assessors to perform the system perimeter scan, they may complete the approved assessor's Compliance Questionnaire in lieu of the version posted on the PCI Council website. What is an external vulnerability scan? An external vulnerability scan involves an automated tool that checks a merchant's or service provider's systems for vulnerabilities. The tool will conduct a non-intrusive scan to remotely review networks and Web applications based on the external-facing Internet protocol (IP) addresses provided by the merchant or service provider. The scan will identify vulnerabilities in operating systems, services, and devices that could be used by hackers to target the company's private network. The tool will not require the merchant or service provider to install any software on their systems, and it will not perform any denial-of-service attacks.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-10", "text": "Who needs to conduct an an external vulnerability scan? The external vulnerability scan is applicable to all merchants and service providers with external-facing IP addresses. Even if an entity does not offer Web-based transactions, there are other services that make systems Internet accessible. Basic functions such as e-mail and employee Internet access will result in the Internet-accessibility of a company's network. These paths to and from the Internet can provide unprotected pathways into merchant and service provider systems if not properly controlled. If a merchant or service provider does not have any external-facing IP addresses, they will only be required to complete the Report On Compliance or the Self Assessment Questionnaire, as applicable. Is the merchant responsible for compliance if they have outsourced the storage, processing, or transmission of cardholder data to a service provider? Merchants should deal only with PCI Data Security Standards-compliant service providers. If there are service providers handling cardholder data on a merchant's behalf, the merchant is still responsible for the security of this data and must ensure that contracts with these service providers specifically include PCI Data Security Standards compliance as a condition of business. Per payment network rules, you must inform Wells Fargo if you are using a service provider. Click on this link for a list of PCI Compliant Service Providers. Do merchants need to include their service providers in the scope of their PCI Data Security Standards review? Yes. Merchants are responsible for the compliance of their service providers. Penalties for non  compliance Are there fines associated with non-compliance of the PCI Data Security Standards? Yes. Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover may impose fines on their member banking institutions when merchants do not comply with PCI Data Security Standards. You are contractually obligated to indemnify and reimburse us, as your acquirer, for such fines.

If cardholder data that you are responsible for is compromised, you may be subject to fines and other liabilities, including the following:  Potential fines (at the discretion of Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, or other card companies). All fraud losses incurred from the use of the compromised account numbers from the date of compromise forward.  Cost of re-issuing cards associated with the compromise.

Chip card technology What is the customer experience when they pay with a chip card? For card present or in-person payments, when a customer presents a chip card, the merchant asks them to insert it into the slot in the PIN pad or terminal, or tap if the card supports contactless payments. The terminal guides the customer through the process. The customer will be prompted to authorize the amount, and may be prompted to enter their PIN or provide a signature. The chip card must remain inserted in the slot through the entire transaction. If it is removed too soon, the transaction will be cancelled.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}
{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-12", "text": "What does the payment experience look like for restaurants and other merchants that accept tips? Accepting tips from a chip card may vary depending on a merchant's point of sale. For example, wireless point-of-sale solutions can simplify the payment process for restaurants since a server can take a wireless chip compatible terminal to the table to collect payment and tip from the customer. Wells Fargo offers POS solutions that cater to restaurants and allow a merchant to capture tips, table mapping, etc.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}

Occasionally you may come across a damaged chip, or a chip card that is not ready to be used. In these scenarios, the chip card terminal or PIN pad may prompt you to swipe the card. The transaction will be processed as a magnetic stripe transaction, and if the card issuer approves the transaction, the issuer is liable for any chip card-related fraud.

{"id": "a2faa65c8cb2-16", "text": "Digital wallet payments How can I accept digital wallet payments like Apple Pay\u00ae? Businesses that accept contactless payments can accept digital payments such as Apple Pay, Google PayTM, and Samsung Pay\u00ae. To accept digital wallet payments  also known as digital payments or digital wallets  at the point of sale, a terminal enabled with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology is required. Additionally, payment gateways can also integrate digital wallet acceptance with your website for card not present payments. Merchants with questions about their terminals or payment gateway's capability to accept digital payments can contact Wells Fargo Merchant Services at 1-800-451-5817. Will merchants be charged a higher rate for transactions made through digital wallets? If the cardholder is making a contactless payment directly on the POS terminal it will be treated as a card present transaction. Merchants with questions should contact Wells Fargo Merchant Services Customer Service at 1-800-451-5817 or their Wells Fargo Merchant Services specialist if they have additional questions. How can merchants let customers know they accept payments from Apple Pay, Google Pay or Samsung Pay? Many customers may already be familiar with the universal contactless acceptance symbol. This symbol usually appears on the front of a merchant's contactless capable terminal or peripheral. In addition, Apple, Google and Samsung have made stickers available for merchants to display at the point of sale. Which cards can be added to a digital wallet? Eligible Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express cards can be used with Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay. What is a contactless payment? Contactless payments are transactions that use chip-based technology and require no physical connection between the payment device (a card or mobile device) and the physical merchant terminal. What is NFC technology? Near-field Communication (NFC) technology enables devices in close proximity to communicate. Payment transactions using NFC technology require a contactless merchant terminal and an NFC-enabled mobile device.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/merchant/"}

A returned item (also known as a non-sufficient funds (NSF) item) occurs when Wells Fargo returns an item (such as a check or other transaction presented for payment) unpaid because there is not enough money in the account to cover it (meaning we do not pay the transaction). Our overdraft fee for items paid into overdraft is $35 per item. We charge no more than four overdraft fees per business day for Business accounts. We do not charge a returned item/non-sufficient funds (NSF) fee for items we return unpaid. However, merchants or other banks may charge fees for returned items.

Overdraft Protection uses available funds from your linked account(s) to cover a transaction if there isn't enough money in your checking account. Debit Card Overdraft Service allows us to authorize, at our discretion, ATM and everyday (one-time) debit card transactions if there isn't enough money in your checking account (or in accounts linked for Overdraft Protection) to cover them. An overdraft fee of $35 per item will apply unless a transfer or a covering deposit is made before the posted cutoff time on the same business day.  If there is not enough money in the checking account (or accounts linked for Overdraft Protection), checks or recurring bill payments you have pre-authorized (such as a utility or phone bill) using your debit card or checking account number may be returned unpaid or approved into overdraft at our discretion whether or not you are enrolled in Debit Card Overdraft Service, and for items paid into overdraft, our standard overdraft fees will apply. Both services are optional and you can sign up for either or both services depending on account eligibility and how you prefer to manage your money.  Though optional, Debit Card Overdraft Service is automatically added to business checking accounts (with the exception of IOLTA/RETA accounts and accounts for government entities) when opened.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/overdraft-services/"}
{"id": "2ea48a92e3be-8", "text": "How much money does Wells Fargo's Overdraft Protection transfer or advance? We will transfer the available money from your linked savings account or advance available credit from your linked credit account to your checking account to cover any negative balance. A minimum of $25 (or the exact amount of the negative balance if over $25) will be transferred from your savings account or credit card. See your credit agreement for the minimum amount that will be transferred from a line of credit. If there isn't enough money in the linked account(s) to cover the entire negative balance, only the available money in the linked account(s) will be transferred. What will happen if I don't have enough money in my account to cover an ATM or everyday (one-time) debit card transaction and I don't have Debit Card Overdraft Service? If your account is not enrolled in Debit Card Overdraft Service, ATM and everyday (one-time) debit card transactions will be declined at the time of the transaction. There are no fees for ATM and everyday (one-time) debit card transactions that are declined. If a checking account is not enrolled in Debit Card Overdraft Service and an ATM or everyday (one-time) debit card transaction creates a negative balance during posting, no overdraft fee will be assessed. Debit Card Overdraft Service does not apply to checks and other transactions such as Bill Pay, ACH, or recurring debit card transactions (such as a utility or phone bill). We may continue to authorize or pay these transactions into overdraft, at our discretion and our standard overdraft fees and policies will apply. How do I decide which services are right for me?

Zelle\u00ae is a convenient way to send and receive money with friends, family and other people or small businesses you know and trust. You can send money to almost anyone with an eligible U.S.-based bank account using just their email address or U.S. mobile phone number. When you enroll with Zelle\u00ae using Wells Fargo Business Online\u00ae or Wells Fargo Mobile\u00ae app, we establish a connection between your email address or U.S. mobile phone number and your eligible Wells Fargo checking or savings account.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/zelle/"}
{"id": "a45ef20a0209-1", "text": "Who can I send money to? You can use Zelle\u00ae to send money to almost any person or small business with an eligible U.S.-based bank account. Eligibility requirements may vary depending on where your recipient banks. For your protection, you should only use Zelle\u00ae when sending money to people or small businesses you know and trust. To send or receive money with a small business, both parties must be enrolled with Zelle\u00ae directly through their U.S.-based financial institution's online or mobile banking experience. Check with your recipient to ensure their correct email address or U.S. mobile phone number is enrolled with Zelle\u00ae so they can receive money. Does Wells Fargo or Zelle\u00ae offer a protection program? Neither Wells Fargo nor Zelle\u00ae offers a protection program for any authorized payments made with Zelle\u00ae \u2013 for example, if you do not receive the item you paid for or the item is not as described or as you expected. Zelle\u00ae is intended to replace instances where cash and checks are being exchanged, so you do not have the same protections associated with a credit card or a debit card transaction, such as the ability to dispute authorized payments. Once you send money with Zelle\u00ae, you cannot cancel the payment if your recipient has already enrolled. We recommend you only send money to known and trusted recipients when using Zelle\u00ae. Is there a fee for Zelle\u00ae? Wells Fargo does not charge a fee to send or receive money with Zelle\u00ae through Wells Fargo Online\u00ae or Wells Fargo Mobile\u00ae. However, when using Zelle\u00ae on a mobile device, your mobile carrier's message and data rates may apply.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/zelle/"}
{"id": "a45ef20a0209-2", "text": "How much money can I send and receive with Zelle\u00ae? For your security, we restrict the amount of money you can send to recipients. These limits will vary based on a number of factors, such as the type of funding account you use, your account and online banking history, your recipient and the transaction history for each recipient. If there is a change to your recipient's enrollment with Zelle\u00ae, the limits may be adjusted. Send limits  There are rolling daily and 30-day limits for established recipients. Note that the amount of money you can send to a new recipient may initially be lower. However, we may adjust the limit when you send subsequent payments to the same recipient. Receiving limits  We do not limit how much money you can receive with Zelle\u00ae using your email address or U.S. mobile phone number. However, the sender may be subject to limits on how much they can send you, based on the policies of their financial institution or payment network. You can receive up to $10,000 per day into each eligible account when someone sends you money using your account number. Payments sent or received using an account number are subject to limits governed by Wells Fargo and not Zelle\u00ae. For more information about Zelle\u00ae sending and receiving limits with Wells Fargo, see the Zelle\u00ae Transfer Service Addendum. These limits apply only to Zelle\u00ae transactions when initiated from Wells Fargo Online\u00ae or Wells Fargo Mobile\u00ae app. When will my payment arrive with Zelle\u00ae? Once your recipient enrolls either a U.S. mobile phone number or email address with Zelle\u00ae, payments are typically delivered within minutes. In some cases, we may need to delay or block a payment for your protection.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//help/faqs/zelle/"}

When you enroll your email address or U.S. mobile number with Wells Fargo to send or receive money with Zelle\u00ae, you are establishing a connection between the email address or U.S. mobile number and your eligible bank account. When someone sends you money, they use your enrolled email address or U.S. mobile number. Once the payment is sent, it will go directly into your account, typically in minutes. U.S. mobile numbers and email addresses can be enrolled to receive money with only one financial institution at a time. If any in your profile are already enrolled elsewhere, you can transfer the enrollment so money sent to that mobile number or email address will be deposited into your Wells Fargo account instead. Only email addresses or U.S. mobile numbers can be used to receive money.

Wells Fargo may send you text messages related to your Zelle\u00ae activity (like when you add a new recipient or when you send money to a first-time recipient). Wells Fargo text messages related to Zelle\u00ae will come from either 93557 or 93729. You can stop text messages related to Zelle\u00ae by following the instructions found in the body of the text messages. Wells Fargo will need to help verify your identity before processing some Zelle\u00ae payments, including when you send money to a first-time recipient. This step requires us to send you a text message code. To complete this verification step, you must have either a text-enabled mobile device or an RSA SecurID\u00ae device. How do I receive money? To receive money, you must enroll an email address or U.S. mobile number with Zelle\u00ae through Wells Fargo Online\u00ae or Wells Fargo Mobile\u00ae. When you enroll a U.S. mobile number or email address, you'll also assign a deposit account for each one. When someone sends you money, the money will go directly into that deposit account and you'll be notified by email or text message. Once enrolled, provide that email address or U.S. mobile number to the person sending you money. They can use it to send you money, whether through Wells Fargo or another Zelle\u00ae participating financial institution. When someone sends you money, you'll be notified by email or text message.

To send a request for money, select Pay & Transfer, Zelle\u00ae and Request. From there, select a recipient (the person who will receive your request) from your list of recipients or add a recipient by selecting the \"+\u201d icon. In order to send payment requests to a U.S. mobile number, the mobile number must already be enrolled with Zelle\u00ae. Next, enter the amount of your request, review it, and select Send.

Note: Request money is not yet available on the Wells Fargo Online\u00ae desktop or tablet experience. What do I do if my recipient never received my payment? If your recipient did not receive your payment, make sure they've enrolled and have enrolled an email address or U.S. mobile number with Zelle\u00ae. If they are enrolled, check that the email address or U.S. mobile number you used to send money to your recipient is associated with your recipient's Zelle\u00ae profile.

Interchange Plus is a pricing structure that passes interchange fees assessed by card issuers, and network and switch fees assessed by the card networks, directly to the merchant services customer (also known as a \"merchant\").

Payment processors, like Wells Fargo Merchant Services, do not control these rates; however, every merchant is required to pay them. Plus: This is the payment processor's charge per transaction on top of the interchange fee. This cost comes in the form of a percentage fee and/or a transaction cost.

The device, which can be carried on a keychain, generates a random 6-digit Personal Access Code that is used to sign on to these services. The Personal Access Code changes every 60 seconds. How does the RSA SecurID device work? The RSA SecurID device generates a random 6-digit numeric Personal Access Code every 60 seconds. Access to certain Wells Fargo services is synchronized between this Personal Access Code and our internal security system. Plus, your RSA SecurID device will work anywhere you have access to Wells Fargo Online\u00ae services. How does the RSA SecurID device make my online transactions more secure? Your transactions are more secure because the device adds an extra layer of password protection. The Personal Access Code is a random number that changes every 60 seconds and each code can only be used once  making it almost impossible for someone to know your Personal Access Code.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//online-banking/securid/"}

If I lose the RSA SecurID device will I have to pay for a replacement? No. There are no costs or fees associated with the replacement of a RSA SecurID device. Am I at risk if my RSA SecurID device gets lost or stolen? Unless someone also has your Wells Fargo Online\u00ae username and password, they will not be able to access services that are protected by the RSA SecurID device. However, you should report the lost or stolen device as soon as possible. Once you report a lost or stolen device, it is deactivated. How long will it take for the RSA SecurID device to be delivered to me? Once you complete the enrollment process for any service that uses the device for authentication, it will be delivered to your business address on file in 14-16 business days. If I cancel my service, what do I do with my RSA SecurID device(s)? You do not need to return the device. We recommend keeping the device in a safe place in case you reactivate your service, or choose to take advantage of new services that use RSA SecurID technology in the future. Will the device work anywhere? Yes. The device does not use a wireless signal to synchronize with Wells Fargo's internal security system, so it will work anywhere you have access to Wells Fargo Online services.

About the PPP loan and loan forgiveness What are the terms of the loan and are there any fees? The term or period of the PPP loan is stated in your promissory note and is either two or five years. The PPP loan will accrue interest at an annual rate of 1%. No payment is due during the deferral period, which ends: On the date when the SBA makes a decision on your application for forgiveness, or; 10 months after the last day of the covered period, if you have not applied for forgiveness.", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//paycheck-protection-forgiveness/faq/"}
{"id": "c707f47cc11e-1", "text": "If your loan is forgiven, any interest accrued during the deferral period is eligible for forgiveness. There is no penalty for loan pre-payment, however partial or full pre-payment may impact forgiveness. After the deferral period, any balance that is not forgiven (including any accrued interest on the unforgiven portion) will become a term loan with monthly payments due up to the maturity date and with an annual interest rate of 1%. For each payment of principal, interest, and/or fees that has not been paid in full within 15 (fifteen) days after its due date, you will be assessed a late charge of $15 or five percent (5%) of the amount due, whichever is greater. There are no annual or documentation fees associated with the loan. However, if you are late on payments after the deferral period, you may be liable for late fees for any portion of the loan that is not forgiven. You will receive a loan statement before any payment is due, so you can plan accordingly. Please refer to the SBA site for more details on the covered period, the term of the loan and other loan forgiveness details. What is the deferral period? Your deferral period ends: On the date when the SBA makes a decision on your application for forgiveness, or; 10 months after the last day of the covered period, if you have not applied for forgiveness. No payment of PPP loan principal, interest, and fees is due during the deferral period. If you received your promissory note before June 5, 2020, it may indicate that your first payment is due 6 months from the date of the note. The PPP Flexibility Act (signed on June 5, 2020) extended the deferral period, so you can disregard the original 6 month period referenced in the promissory note.

{"id": "c707f47cc11e-2", "text": "What are Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) and advances and how do they affect loan forgiveness? Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) are direct loans, while EIDL advances are grants. The SBA set the maximum EIDL advance at $10,000. EIDL advances will no longer be deducted by the SBA from forgiveness amounts. You may be able to refinance EIDL loans funded between 1/31/2020 and 4/3/2020 with your first PPP loan. You cannot refinance an EIDL loan with a Second Draw PPP Loan. For any questions related to the SBA EIDL program, or to obtain an EIDL loan payoff amount, contact the SBA Disaster Loan Servicing Center at (800) 736-6048 or refer to the SBA. Are PPP loans eligible for loan forgiveness? PPP loans, in whole or in part, are eligible for loan forgiveness if funds were used for certain eligible business expenses.

A CD is a financial product that usually pays a fixed interest rate for a set period of time, ranging from a few months to several years. This period of time is known as a term\". By depositing your money into a CD for a set term, you lock in your initial deposit principal and interest rate until your money matures. You earn interest from the date of your opening deposit up to your maturity date. Your interest compounds daily and is generally paid monthly, although interest payments made quarterly, semi-annually, annually, or at maturity are also available. Interest can be re-deposited to the CD, transferred to a Wells Fargo checking or savings account, or paid to you via check if your CD has a minimum balance of $5,000. Benefits of CDs There are a number of reasons you may want to open a CD: Interest rates. CDs typically pay higher interest rates than other deposit products. Higher CD rates may be available for longer terms or larger deposited amounts. Guaranteed return. Since the interest rate of a Fixed Rate CD is set at account opening and does not change until the CD matures, you know exactly how much money you will earn during the term of your CD. Security. Your funds are FDIC-insured up to the maximum applicable limits. You can withdraw your funds early if you need to, but you may be assessed an early withdrawal penalty or a Regulation D penalty. See additional details in the Wells Fargo CD rate and penalty disclosures below. What happens when your CD matures? Approximately one month before your CD matures, you'll be sent a notice reminding you of the maturity date.

{"id": "36c7a573c7d4-0", "text": "How To Protect Intellectual Property  Wells Fargo Skip to main content Diverse Businesses Women Entrepreneurs Small Business Resources Running your Business Growing your Business Money and your Business Search Go Intellectual property: What it is, how to protect it February 2023 Monitor ideas, secrets, and branding  and ways to do it. As a business owner, you manage many assets on a daily basis, but you may be overlooking an important one: intellectual property. Your intellectual property includes the intangible assets you create for your business, such as names, designs, and automated processes. And just like tangible possessions  like supplies, equipment, buildings, and inventory  your intellectual property contributes to the value and success of your business. So it needs to be monitored and protected. Here's a breakdown of common types of intellectual property and tips on how you can protect these assets. Trademarks Trademarks are the words, phrases, and symbols that differentiate your brand from others in your industry. They must be distinctive and used in commerce to sell or promote a product or service in order to qualify as trademarks. Examples: Company and product names Slogans and taglines Logos and symbols Brand colors", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//wells-fargo-works/planning-operations/security-fraud-protection/four-examples-of-intellectual-property/"}
{"id": "36c7a573c7d4-1", "text": "Company and product names Slogans and taglines Logos and symbols Brand colors How you can protect them: Trademarks may be registered with the federal government or your state government. Federally registered trademarks protect your rights throughout the U.S., while state-registered trademarks protect your rights only within the state's territory. While you're not required to register a trademark, having a registered trademark can make it easier to challenge anyone who infringes on your trademark rights. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) provides information on how to register your trademarks at the state or national level. Federal trademarks last as long as you use them with the public to promote your goods or services. Trademark applications generally cost between $250 and $350 per class of goods or services. To see if your desired trademark is available, you can begin searching the USPTO website or with a general internet search. A trademark lawyer can help you do a more detailed search to determine the availability of your desired trademark. Copyrights A copyright grants you legal rights to anything you create that expresses or embodies an idea. It gives you exclusive rights to copy, distribute, reproduce, display, and license the work. Examples: Software Architectural designs Graphic arts Video and sound recordings Books and blog articles Databases", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//wells-fargo-works/planning-operations/security-fraud-protection/four-examples-of-intellectual-property/"}
{"id": "36c7a573c7d4-2", "text": "Architectural designs Graphic arts Video and sound recordings Books and blog articles Databases How you can protect them: Like trademarks, you have some rights to your original work without registering the copyright at the U.S. Copyright Office. However, registering can give you more leverage if you ever need to take an infringer to court. For instance, if an employee writes an article or takes a photo within the scope of their employment, the employer is the copyright owner automatically. However, an independent contractor who writes an article or takes a photo will be the copyright owner of that asset unless they transfer the copyright through a written contract. As with trademarks, registering them officially can give you more leverage in the event of a dispute. A copyright empowers you to profit from your creative assets. You can sell your copyrighted assets and lease them in exchange for license fees and royalties. A new copyright owned by an individual typically lasts 70 years after the death of the copyright owner. A copyright owned by a limited liability company (LLC) or other legal entity will last 95 years from the first date the work was used with the public. You can file to register a copyright with the United States Copyright Office. The current online application fee for basic registrations is $45 to $65. Patents Patents are granted for new, useful inventions, and they will give you the right to prevent others from making, using, or selling your invention. Examples: Utility patents: for tangible inventions, such as products, machines, devices, and composite materials, as well as new and useful processes Design patents: the ornamental designs on manufactured products Plant patents: new varieties of plants", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//wells-fargo-works/planning-operations/security-fraud-protection/four-examples-of-intellectual-property/"}
{"id": "36c7a573c7d4-3", "text": "How you can protect them: Patent applications can be filed in the United States with the USPTO, and internationally in the patent office of the applicable country or region. U.S. utility and plant patents have a term of 20 years, while design patents have a term of 15 years. Patents require a nonrefundable filing fee, along with issue, service, and maintenance fees. This can add up to thousands of dollars, but some small businesses qualify for discounts. Before submitting your patent application, you can (but are not required to) search existing patents and published patent applications to see if your concept has comparatively novel features. A patent lawyer can help you do a more thorough search to determine the availability of patent protection for your concept. They can also help you investigate whether any third parties have patents that could prevent you from bringing your product or service to market. Trade secrets A trade secret is a piece of confidential business information whose secrecy gives you an advantage over your competitors. Examples: Formulas Patterns Methods, techniques, and processes", "url": "https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz//wells-fargo-works/planning-operations/security-fraud-protection/four-examples-of-intellectual-property/"}
{"id": "36c7a573c7d4-4", "text": "Formulas Patterns Methods, techniques, and processes How you can protect them: Though trade secrets cannot be registered, they are protected through internal policies to ensure the secrecy is maintained. Some examples of ways to protect trade secrets include internal policies that restrict access to the trade secret, employment agreements, and non-disclosure agreements. You can take legal action against those who misappropriate your trade secrets. Get started: Put protections in your business plan Intellectual property rights can help you establish your brand identity, profit off your unique assets, and prevent others from using your creations. Making them part of your business plan can help ensure nothing's missed. Start by listing all your intellectual property assets, then consider which assets need to be protected. Budget for the time and money you'll need to properly secure the rights to your creations, and outline how you plan to protect your intellectual assets. Finally, set deadlines for research, filing, and finalizing these steps and work toward them as you would any other business goal.
